# Product Requirements Document: Gemma 3 Tool Calling Image Recognition Service

## Overview
This project aims to enhance the existing Gemma 3 proxy server to support tool calling capabilities with a focus on image recognition. The service will build on the current OpenAI-compatible API server that already exposes Gemma 3 models, adding functionality to process images, manage memory, and handle tool calls similar to OpenAI's function calling feature.

## Current System
- Existing Gemma 3 proxy server (gemma_proxy.py) that provides an OpenAI-compatible API
- Support for running Gemma 3 models (gemma-3-4b-it)
- Basic chat completion functionality
- Server runs on uvicorn with customizable host and port

## Requirements

### 1. Tool Calling Framework
- Implement a tool calling framework similar to OpenAI's function calling
- Support for defining, registering, and executing tools
- Ability to parse and validate tool call requests from the model
- Support for returning tool call results back to the model

### 2. Image Recognition Capabilities
- Add support for processing and analyzing images
- Implement image recognition tools that can be called by the model
- Support common image operations: object detection, classification, OCR, etc.
- Handle various image formats and sizes

### 3. Memory Management
- Implement short-term conversation memory
- Support for long-term memory storage and retrieval
- Memory chunking and efficient storage mechanisms
- Context window management for optimal model performance

### 4. Response Management
- Support for chunking/splitting long responses
- Streaming capabilities for real-time responses
- Proper error handling and recovery mechanisms

### 5. API Enhancements
- Extend the OpenAI-compatible API to support tool calling
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing chat completion endpoints
- Add new endpoints for tool registration and management
- Comprehensive documentation for API usage

### 6. Performance Optimization
- Optimize image processing for speed and efficiency
- Implement caching mechanisms for frequently used tools and images
- Ensure minimal latency for tool execution

### 7. Testing and Validation
- Comprehensive test suite for all new functionality
- Integration tests for the entire system
- Performance benchmarks for various operations

## Technical Constraints
- Use UV for Python environment management
- Build on top of the existing gemma_proxy.py implementation
- Maintain compatibility with the current API structure
- Ensure the system can run with reasonable performance on standard hardware

## Success Criteria
- Successfully process and analyze images through tool calls
- Maintain response quality comparable to direct model calls
- Handle complex multi-turn conversations with tool usage
- Achieve reasonable performance metrics for image processing operations
- Provide comprehensive documentation and examples
