2024--18ListenShareI‚Äôve worked on Next.js applications that scaled to over 100k monthly active users and landing pages with millions of monthly visitors. In this article, I‚Äôll share all the lessons I‚Äôve learned through countless iterations.Whether you‚Äôre part of a small team of one, two, or three developers, or you work on a massive Next.js project with multiple teams on the same codebase, it‚Äôs critical to get the foundation of your app right from the start. Even if you‚Äôre working on an existing project, you will discover some hard-earned insights that you can apply to your app today.Let me take you by the hand and show you all the steps and packages that you want to set up and explain to you why they‚Äôre useful, so your app scales smoothly.Initialize Your ProjectBegin by creating a new","you why they‚Äôre useful, so your app scales smoothly.Initialize Your ProjectBegin by creating a new Next.js project.npx create-next-app@latestIt may ask you if it can install the latest create-next-app version, just hit yes.Need to install the following packages:create-next-app@15.0.0Ok to proceed?

Discuss choices like using semicolons, quote styles, and tabs versus spaces with your team.Then use tools to enforce your style guide and format code automatically.There are two tools for that: Prettier and ESLint.PrettierPrettier is an opinionated code formatter that eliminates style","that: Prettier and ESLint.PrettierPrettier is an opinionated code formatter that eliminates style discussions during code reviews.Install Prettier together with its Tailwind plugin.npm install --save-dev prettier prettier-plugin-tailwindcssCreate aprettier.config.js file with your preferred rules.module.exports = {  arrowParens: 'avoid',  bracketSameLine: false,  bracketSpacing: true,  htmlWhitespaceSensitivity: 'css',  insertPragma: false,  jsxSingleQuote: false,  plugins: ['prettier-plugin-tailwindcss'],  printWidth: 80,  proseWrap: 'always',  quoteProps: 'as-needed',  requirePragma: false,  semi: true,  singleQuote: true,  tabWidth: 2,  trailingComma: 'all',  useTabs: false,};Add a formatting script to your package.json.\"format\": \"prettier --write .\",Run the formatter to apply your style.$ npm run format> nextjs-for-production@0.1.0 format> prettier --write .next.config.mjs 4ms (unchanged)package-lock.json 54ms (unchanged)package.json 1ms (unchanged)postcss.config.mjs 2ms","4ms (unchanged)package-lock.json 54ms (unchanged)package.json 1ms (unchanged)postcss.config.mjs 2ms (unchanged)README.md 20ms (unchanged)src/app/globals.css 17ms (unchanged)src/app/layout.tsx 30ms (unchanged)src/app/page.tsx 11ms (unchanged)tailwind.config.ts 2ms (unchanged)tsconfig.json 2ms (unchanged)Your files are now ‚Äúprettier‚Äù, but you also want to use ESLint.ESLintESLint can scan your code for both stylistic and logical issues.

You must specify a name for the migration after the command.‚Äúprisma:push‚Äù: Pushes the schema changes directly to the database and updates the Prisma Client. Useful for prototyping without creating migration files.‚Äúprisma:reset-dev‚Äù: Resets the development database by wiping it, re-seeding it, and applying migrations in development mode.‚Äúprisma:seed‚Äù: Runs a TypeScript seed script to populate the database with initial data.‚Äúprisma:setup‚Äù: Generates the Prisma Client, deploys migrations to the database, and pushes the schema to the database.‚Äúprisma:studio‚Äù: Opens Prisma Studio, a GUI for viewing and editing the database records.‚Äúprisma:wipe‚Äù: Resets the database by forcefully dropping all data and migrations and then pushes the schema","Resets the database by forcefully dropping all data and migrations and then pushes the schema changes.npm run prisma:setupIf your Prisma doesn‚Äôt recognize your .env.local, set your environment variable manually in your terminal. On Mac, this can be done using theexport command.export DATABASE_URL=\"postgresql://johndoe:randompassword@localhost:5432/mydb?schema=public\"Create a primsa/seed.ts.

A facade is a design pattern where you provide a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.Create a file that contains all facades related to your user profile model features/user-profile/user-profile-model.ts.import { UserProfile } from '@prisma/client';import prisma from '@/lib/prisma';export async function retrieveUserProfileFromDatabaseByEmail(  email: UserProfile['email'],) {  return await","function retrieveUserProfileFromDatabaseByEmail(  email: UserProfile['email'],) {  return await prisma.userProfile.findUnique({ where: { email } });}There are two main reasons for using facades.Increase vendor resistance ‚Äî You can switch third-party providers easily. For example, you might switch from Firebase to Supabase or vice versa. Instead of updating your whole codebase to reflect the change, you only update the facade.Simplify your code ‚Äî A facade can reduce the code you need to write in your application because it reduces the API to your specific application needs. Simultaneously, it makes your code easier to understand because you can give the facade descriptive names.Then use your facade in your server component.import { retrieveUserProfileFromDatabaseByEmail } from '@/features/user-profiles/user-profiles-model';import {  Card,  CardContent,  CardHeader,  CardTitle,} from '@/components/ui/card';export default async function Dashboard() {  const user =    await","from '@/components/ui/card';export default async function Dashboard() {  const user =    await retrieveUserProfileFromDatabaseByEmail('jan@reactsquad.io');  return (    <Card className=\"max-w-md mx-auto\">      <CardHeader>        <CardTitle>User Profile</Card.Title>      </CardHeader>      <CardContent>        {user ? (          <ul>            <li>Name: {user.name}</li>            <li>Email: {user.email}</li>          </ul>        ) : (          <p>User not found.</p>        )}      </CardContent>    </Card>  );}Vercel PostgresYou can use Vercel Postgres for your production deployment. They have an easy to follow guide, which you can check out in the Vercel documentation. But here are the steps real quick for your convenience.To set up a database in your Vercel project, follow these steps:Go to the Storage tab and click the Create Database button.When the Browse Storage modal opens, choose Postgres and click Continue.For creating a new database:In the dialog box, type","modal opens, choose Postgres and click Continue.For creating a new database:In the dialog box, type sample_postgres_db (or a name you prefer) in the Store Name field. Ensure the name has only alphanumeric characters, \"_\" or \"-\", and does not exceed 32 characters.Choose a region. For lower latency, select a region close to your function region, which is US East by default.Click Create.Then you‚Äôll need to add POSTGRES_URL_NON_POOLING to the datasource in your Prisma schema.datasource db {  provider  = \"postgresql\"  // Uses connection pooling  url       = env(\"DATABASE_URL\")  // Uses direct connection, ‚ö†Ô∏è make sure to keep this to `POSTGRES_URL_NON_POOLING`  // or you'll have dangling databases from migrations  directUrl = env(\"POSTGRES_URL_NON_POOLING\")}Vercel uses connection poolers, which manage a pool of database connections that can be reused by different parts of an application, rather than establishing a new connection for each database request. The directUrl property is used to","than establishing a new connection for each database request. The directUrl property is used to ensure operations requiring direct database access, such as migrations, can bypass the connection pooler for reliable execution.You can get the environment variables for your Vercel database by pulling them from Vercel.vercel env pull .envPlaywrightYou also want to use E2E tests because E2E tests give you the most confidence that your app works as intended. E2E tests are skipped far too often, but you really should make it a habit to write them.

In this article, I'll share all the lessons I've learned through countless iterations.Whether you're part of a small team of one, two, or three developers, or you work on a massive Next.js project with multiple teams on the same codebase, it's critical to get the foundation of your app right from the start. Even if you're working on an existing project, you will discover some hard-earned insights that you can apply to your app today.Let me take you by the hand and show you all the steps and packages that you want to set up and explain to you why they're useful, so your app scales","and packages that you want to set up and explain to you why they're useful, so your app scales smoothly.Initialize Your ProjectBegin by creating a new Next.js project.npx create-next-app@latest","It may ask you if it can install the latest create-next-app version, just hit yes.Need to install the following packages:\ncreate-next-app@15.0.0\nOk to proceed? (y)\nAnd then configure your project by hitting yes on everything (TypeScript, Tailwind, app router).‚úî **What is your project named?** ‚Ä¶ reactsquad-production\n‚úî **Would you like to use** **TypeScript****?** ‚Ä¶ No / Yes\nYes\n‚úî **Would you like to use** **ESLint****?** ‚Ä¶ No / Yes\nYes\n‚úî **Would you like to use** **Tailwind CSS****?** ‚Ä¶ No / Yes\nYes\n‚úî **Would you like to use** **`src/` directory****?** ‚Ä¶ No / Yes\nYes\n‚úî **Would you like to use** **App Router****?

Discuss choices like using semicolons, quote styles, and tabs versus spaces with your team.Then use tools to enforce your style guide and format code automatically.There are two tools for that: Prettier and ESLint.PrettierPrettier is an opinionated code formatter that eliminates style discussions during code reviews.Install Prettier together with its Tailwind plugin.npm install --save-dev prettier prettier-plugin-tailwindcss\nCreate a prettier.config.js file with your preferred rules.module.exports = {\n  arrowParens: 'avoid',\n  bracketSameLine: false,\n  bracketSpacing: true,\n  htmlWhitespaceSensitivity: 'css',\n  insertPragma: false,\n  jsxSingleQuote: false,\n  plugins: ['prettier-plugin-tailwindcss'],\n  printWidth: 80,\n  proseWrap: 'always',\n  quoteProps: 'as-needed',","printWidth: 80,\n  proseWrap: 'always',\n  quoteProps: 'as-needed',\n  requirePragma: false,\n  semi: true,\n  singleQuote: true,\n  tabWidth: 2,\n  trailingComma: 'all',\n  useTabs: false,\n};\nAdd a formatting script to your package.json.\"format\": \"prettier --write .\",\nRun the formatter to apply your style.$ npm run format","> nextjs-for-production@0.1.0 format\n> prettier --write .","next.config.mjs 4ms (unchanged)\npackage-lock.json 54ms (unchanged)\npackage.json 1ms (unchanged)\npostcss.config.mjs 2ms (unchanged)\nREADME.md 20ms (unchanged)\nsrc/app/globals.css 17ms (unchanged)\nsrc/app/layout.tsx 30ms (unchanged)\nsrc/app/page.tsx 11ms (unchanged)\ntailwind.config.ts 2ms (unchanged)\ntsconfig.json 2ms (unchanged)\nYour files are now \"prettier\", but you also want to use ESLint.ESLintESLint can scan your code for both stylistic and logical issues. Install ESLint and its plugins, like unicorn, playwright and import sort.npm install --save-dev @typescript-eslint/parser eslint-plugin-unicorn eslint-plugin-import eslint-plugin-playwright eslint-config-prettier eslint-plugin-prettier eslint-plugin-simple-import-sort\nUpdate your .eslintrc.json.{\n  \"extends\": [\n    \"next/core-web-vitals\",\n    \"plugin:unicorn/recommended\",\n    \"plugin:import/recommended\",\n    \"plugin:playwright/recommended\",\n    \"plugin:prettier/recommended\"\n  ],\n  \"plugins\": [\"simple-import-sort\"],\n  \"rules\": {","\"plugin:prettier/recommended\"\n  ],\n  \"plugins\": [\"simple-import-sort\"],\n  \"rules\": {\n    \"simple-import-sort/exports\": \"error\",\n    \"simple-import-sort/imports\": \"error\",\n    \"unicorn/no-array-callback-reference\": \"off\",\n    \"unicorn/no-array-for-each\": \"off\",\n    \"unicorn/no-array-reduce\": \"off\",\n    \"unicorn/prevent-abbreviations\": [\n      \"error\",\n      {\n        \"allowList\": {\n          \"e2e\": true\n        },\n        \"replacements\": {\n          \"props\": false,\n          \"ref\": false,\n          \"params\": false\n        }\n      }\n    ]\n  },\n  \"overrides\": [\n    {\n      \"files\": [\"*.js\"],\n      \"rules\": {\n        \"unicorn/prefer-module\": \"off\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}","\"rules\": {\n        \"unicorn/prefer-module\": \"off\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\nThis tutorial's plugins offer different functions. For detailed descriptions, visit their respective GitHub pages.But in short, they enforce coding standards, organize imports, and ensure correct use of modern JavaScript features. Since ESLint and Prettier can conflict, this setup makes them work together smoothly. The plugins also help prevent bugs and keep styles consistent, especially with tools like Vitest and Playwright.Add a linting script to your package.json.\"lint:fix\": \"next lint --fix\",\nRun it to format all files according to your new rules.$ npm run lint:fix","> nextjs-for-production@0.1.0 lint:fix\n> next lint --fix","‚úî No ESLint warnings or errors\nIf you get a TypeScript version warning, you can ignore that.Note: As of this article's writing, ESLint 9 is available, but this tutorial uses ESLint 8 because many plugins do not yet support the latest version.CommitlintWhen collaborating with a large team, it's also helpful to enforce consistent commit messages to keep the project history clear. By choosing the right standards, you can automate changelog and release generation with correct semantic versioning.Install Commitlint and its necessary configurations. This includes Husky, which helps manage Git hooks.npm install --save-dev @commitlint/cli@latest @commitlint/config-conventional@latest husky@latest\nInitialize Husky in your project to set up the basic configuration.npx husky-init && npm install\nAdd hooks to automate linting and type checking before each commit, and customize your commit message workflow.npx husky add .husky/pre-commit 'npm run lint && npm run type-check'","npx husky add .husky/prepare-commit-msg 'exec < /dev/tty && npx cz --hook || true'\nThe pre-commit hook runs after git commit, but before the commit message is finalized and runs linting and type-checking on your code.The prepare-commit-msg hook runs after git commit is initiated but before the commit message editor opens. It runs commitizen CLI to let you craft conventional commit messages. You'll learn how to use this hook in a bit.Remove the line that says npm test from .husky/_/pre-commit.Make sure these scripts are executable.chmod a+x .husky/pre-commit\nchmod a+x .husky/prepare-commit-msg\nHere, chmod stands for \"change mode.\" This command allows you to change the access permissions or modes of a file or directory in Unix and Unix-like operating systems. The argument a+x adds execute permissions for all users.Install Commitizen, which provides a CLI for crafting conventional commit messages.npm install --save-dev commitizen cz-conventional-changelog","Configure Commitizen in your package.json to use the conventional changelog standard.\"config\": {\n  \"commitizen\": {\n    \"path\": \"cz-conventional-changelog\"\n  }\n},\nThe conventional changeloge standard is a specification for adding human and machine-readable meaning to commit messages. It is designed to automate the producing of changelogs and releases based on the Git history of your project.A future article will explain this standard in detail. It's included in this tutorial because getting it right from the start is important. You can use it and benefit from it without needing an in-depth understanding.Create your commitlint.config.cjs file with rules that suit your team's needs. This setup ensures your commit messages are consistent and relevant to the changes made.const config = {\n  extends: ['@commitlint/config-conventional'],\n  rules: {\n    'references-empty': [1, 'never'],\n    'footer-max-line-length': [0, 'always'],\n    'body-max-line-length': [0, 'always'],\n  },\n};","module.exports = config;\nRun the following command to start crafting your commit messages using a guided CLI.$ git add --all\n$ npx cz\ncz-cli@4.3.0, cz-conventional-changelog@3.3.0","?

It has the following benefits:Scalability: Large applications are easier to scale and maintain because each feature acts like a mini-application. You avoid scrolling up and down in your file list to find all the files you need.Collaboration: Developers can focus on specific features without disrupting others‚Äô work.Onboarding: New developers understand the project structure faster, as all files for a feature are in one place.Refactoring: Updating a feature is streamlined since all its elements are grouped together.Modularity: Features can be reused, shared, or turned into standalone packages more easily.Micro-frontends: If your application ever grows to 30 or more engineers, it is easy to refactor to micro-frontends.Here is a more concrete example.src/","‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app/\n‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ...\n‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ (group)/\n‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ about/\n‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ page.tsx\n‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ settings/\n‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ page.tsx\n‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ layout.tsx\n‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dashboard/\n‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ page.tsx\n‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ layout.tsx\n‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ layout.tsx\n‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ page.tsx\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/\n‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ...\n‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ header/\n‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ header-component.tsx\n‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ header-component.test.ts\n‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ header.module.css\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ features/\n‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ...\n‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ todos/\n‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ...\n‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ todos-component.tsx\n‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ todos-component.test.ts\n‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ todos-container.ts\n‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ todos-reducer.ts\n‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ todos-reducer.test.ts\n‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ todos-styles.ts\n‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ user/\n‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ...\n‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ user-reducer.ts\n‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ user-reducer.test.ts\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hocs/\n‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ...\n‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ with-layout.tsx\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hooks/\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ redux/\n‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ root-reducer.ts\n‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ root-saga.ts\n‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ store.ts\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ...\n‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ middleware.ts","‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ redux/\n‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ root-reducer.ts\n‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ root-saga.ts\n‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ store.ts\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ...\n‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ middleware.ts\nThis example shows you how you can organize your src/ directory. Generally, everything is grouped by feature. Tests files live next to their respective implementation files. But anything that is shared by multiple features is then grouped in general folders, such as components/ or HOCs/ or hooks/. Shared setup for state management - in this example for Redux - lives in a redux/ folder.Some people also like to group by feature within the app/ folder.

Vitest is a great choice because it has the same API as the most popular framework, which is Jest, but it runs faster.Install Vitest.npm install -D vitest\nAnd configure a testing command in your package.json.\"test\": \"vitest --reporter=verbose\",\nThen create an example.test.ts file and write a short test to check to check Vitest works.import { describe, expect, test } from 'vitest';","describe('example', () => {\n  test('given a passing test: passes', () => {\n    expect(1).toStrictEqual(1);\n  });\n});\nIt should pass.$ npm test\n\n> nextjs-for-production@0.1.0 test\n> vitest --reporter=verbose\n\n\n DEV  v2.0.5 /Users/jan/dev/nextjs-for-production\n\n ‚úì src/example.test.ts (1)\n   ‚úì example (1)\n     ‚úì given a passing test: passes\n\n Test Files  1 passed (1)\n      Tests  1 passed (1)\n   Start at  14:06:24\n   Duration  203ms (transform 20ms, setup 0ms, collect 17ms, tests 1ms, environment 0ms, prepare 56ms)","PASS  Waiting for file changes...\n       press h to show help, press q to quit\nIf you want to learn how you can write better tests, check out this article that teaches you 12 evergreen testing principles that every senior developer should know.React Testing LibraryYou also want to write tests for your React components. For that, you can use the React Testing Library, often abbreviated as RTL.npm install --save-dev @testing-library/react @testing-library/dom @testing-library/jest-dom @testing-library/user-event @types/react @types/react-dom happy-dom @vitejs/plugin-react vite-tsconfig-paths\nThen, create a vitest.config.ts file.import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react';\nimport tsconfigPaths from 'vite-tsconfig-paths';\nimport { defineConfig } from 'vitest/config';","export default defineConfig({\n  plugins: [react(), tsconfigPaths()],\n  server: {\n    port: 3000,\n  },\n  test: {\n    environment: 'happy-dom',\n    globals: true,\n    setupFiles: ['./src/tests/setup-test-environment.ts'],\n    include: ['./src/**/*.{spec,test}.{js,mjs,cjs,ts,mts,cts,jsx,tsx}'],\n    watch: {\n      ignored: [\n        String.raw`.*\\\\/node_modules\\\\/.*`,\n        String.raw`.*\\\\/build\\\\/.*`,\n        String.raw`.*\\\\/postgres-data\\\\/.*`,\n      ],\n    },\n    coverage: {\n      reporter: ['text', 'json', 'html'],\n    },\n  },\n});\nIt sets up the development server, specifies testing parameters like that the ¬†environment is happy-dom and file paths, and defines coverage report formats.And create a file called src/tests/setup-test-environment.ts to set up your test environment.import '@testing-library/jest-dom/vitest';\n\n// See <https://reactjs.org/blog/2022/03/08/react-18-upgrade-guide.html#configuring-your-testing-environment>.","// @ts-ignore\nglobalThis.IS_REACT_ACT_ENVIRONMENT = true;\nThe first line imports additional assertions, which extend Vitest's built-in assertions, allowing you to more easily test DOM nodes. For example, you can check if an element is visible, has a certain text content, or includes specific attributes.The global environment flag ensures that tests involving state updates work as expected without timing issues.Next, you want to set up a custom render method src/tests/react-test-utils.tsx./* eslint-disable import/export */\nimport type { RenderOptions } from '@testing-library/react';\nimport { render } from '@testing-library/react';\nimport type { ReactElement } from 'react';\n\nconst customRender = (\n  ui: ReactElement,\n  options?: Omit<RenderOptions, 'queries'>,\n) =>\n  render(ui, {\n    wrapper: ({ children }) => <>{children}</>,\n    ...options,\n  });\n\n// re-export everything\nexport * from '@testing-library/react';","// re-export everything\nexport * from '@testing-library/react';\n\n// override render method\nexport { customRender as render };\nexport { default as userEvent } from '@testing-library/user-event';\nYou can use this to wrap your code in providers, for example, when using Redux, or adding layouts and styling.Make sure your configuration worked by writing a test for a React component.import { describe, expect, test } from 'vitest';\n\nimport { render, screen } from '@/tests/react-test-utils';\n\nfunction MyReactComponent() {\n  return <div>My React Component</div>;\n}\n\ndescribe('MyReactComponent', () => {\n  test('given no props: renders a text', () => {\n    render(<MyReactComponent />);","expect(screen.getByText('My React Component')).toBeInTheDocument();\n  });\n});\nYou import render and screen from your test utils file instead of from RTL directly.toBeInTheDocument() is one of those special assertions that you configured earlier in your test environment setup file.It should pass, too. ‚úì src/features/example.test.tsx (1)\n   ‚úì MyReactComponent (1)\n     ‚úì given no props: renders a text\n\n Test Files  1 passed (1)\n      Tests  1 passed (1)\n   Start at  09:33:32\n   Duration  402ms (transform 24ms, setup 55ms, collect 87ms, tests 9ms, environment 80ms, prepare 45ms)","PASS  Waiting for file changes...\n       press h to show help, press q to quit\nStylingNow let's talk about styling.

This gives you the flexibility to use a variety of databases, and simplifies the API that you use to interact with it.npm install prisma --save-dev\nYou'll also need to install the Prisma client.npm install @prisma/client\nInitialize Prisma.npx prisma init\nThis auto-generates your prisma/schema.prisma file.generator client {\n  provider = \"prisma-client-js\"\n}\n\ndatasource db {\n  provider = \"postgresql\"\n  // Uses connection pooling\n  url = env(\"DATABASE_URL\")\n}","model UserProfile {\n  id                         String   @id @default(cuid())\n  createdAt                  DateTime @default(now())\n  updatedAt                  DateTime @updatedAt\n  email                      String   @unique\n  name                       String   @default(\"\")\n  acceptedTermsAndConditions Boolean  @default(false)\n}\nAdd a aUserProfile model to it, which has an email and a name and a boolean whether they accepted your terms and conditions.If you ran npx prisma init, rename your .env file to .env.local, otherwise create it and make sure it contains the credentials for your Prisma database.DATABASE_URL=\"postgresql://johndoe:randompassword@localhost:5432/mydb?schema=public\"\nNow create a src/lib/prisma.ts file, which will contain your Prisma client connection.import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client';\n\ndeclare global {\n  var __database__: PrismaClient;\n}\n\nlet prisma: PrismaClient;","declare global {\n  var __database__: PrismaClient;\n}\n\nlet prisma: PrismaClient;\n\nif (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production') {\n  prisma = new PrismaClient();\n} else {\n  if (!global.__database__) {\n    global.__database__ = new PrismaClient();\n  }\n  prisma = global.__database__;\n}","export default prisma;\nThe re-assignment ensures that in a non-production environment (like during development or testing), only one instance of the Prisma client is created and reused across the entire application. This approach prevents the overhead of repeatedly initializing new connections to the database every time a module that needs database access is imported.Modify your package.json to include the following helper commands for Prisma.\"prisma:deploy\": \"npx prisma migrate deploy && npx prisma generate\",\n\"prisma:migrate\": \"npx prisma migrate dev --name\",\n\"prisma:push\": \"npx prisma db push && npx prisma generate\",\n\"prisma:reset-dev\": \"run-s prisma:wipe prisma:seed dev\",\n\"prisma:seed\": \"tsx ./prisma/seed.ts\",\n\"prisma:setup\": \"prisma generate && prisma migrate deploy && prisma db push\",\n\"prisma:studio\": \"npx prisma studio\",\n\"prisma:wipe\": \"npx prisma migrate reset --force && npx prisma db push\",","\"prisma:wipe\": \"npx prisma migrate reset --force && npx prisma db push\",\nSome of these commands use the run-s, tsx and dotenv packages, which you'll need to install.npm install --save-dev npm-run-all tsx dotenv","Here‚Äôs an explanation of each Prisma command:\"prisma:deploy\": Deploys database migrations and generates Prisma Client. It runs migrations on production databases and updates the client API.\"prisma:migrate\": Creates a new migration from changes in the Prisma schema, applying it in the development environment. You must specify a name for the migration after the command.\"prisma:push\": Pushes the schema changes directly to the database and updates the Prisma Client. Useful for prototyping without creating migration files.\"prisma:reset-dev\": Resets the development database by wiping it, re-seeding it, and applying migrations in development mode.\"prisma:seed\": Runs a TypeScript seed script to populate the database with initial data.\"prisma:setup\": Generates the Prisma Client, deploys migrations to the database, and pushes the schema to the database.\"prisma:studio\": Opens Prisma Studio, a GUI for viewing and editing the database records.\"prisma:wipe\": Resets the database by forcefully","a GUI for viewing and editing the database records.\"prisma:wipe\": Resets the database by forcefully dropping all data and migrations and then pushes the schema changes.npm run prisma:setup","If your Prisma doesn't recognize your .env.local file, set your environment variable manually in your terminal. On Mac, this can be done using the export command.export DATABASE_URL=\"postgresql://johndoe:randompassword@localhost:5432/mydb?schema=public\"\nCreate a prisma/seed.ts file. You can use it to seed your database with data for development.import { exit } from 'node:process';","import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client';\nimport dotenv from 'dotenv';\n\ndotenv.config({ path: '.env.local' });\n\nconst prisma = new PrismaClient();\n\nconst prettyPrint = (object: any) =>\n  console.log(JSON.stringify(object, undefined, 2));\n\nasync function seed() {\n  const user = await prisma.userProfile.create({\n    data: {\n      email: 'jan@reactsquad.io',\n      name: 'Jan Hesters',\n      acceptedTermsAndConditions: true,\n    },\n  });\n\n  console.log('========= üå± result of seed: =========');\n  prettyPrint({ user });\n}\n\nseed()\n  .then(async () => {\n    await prisma.$disconnect();\n  })\n  // eslint-disable-next-line unicorn/prefer-top-level-await\n  .catch(async error => {\n    console.error(error);\n    await prisma.$disconnect();\n    exit(1);\n  });\nIf you run it, it'll create your user.$ npm run prisma:seed\n\n> reactsquad-production@0.1.0 prisma:seed\n> tsx ./prisma/seed.ts","> reactsquad-production@0.1.0 prisma:seed\n> tsx ./prisma/seed.ts\n\n========= üå± result of seed: =========\n{\n  \"user\": {\n    \"id\": \"clzekb5sp0000ock9gsp72p33\",\n    \"createdAt\": \"2024-08-03T20:04:27.289Z\",\n    \"updatedAt\": \"2024-08-03T20:04:27.289Z\",\n    \"email\": \"jan@reactsquad.io\",\n    \"name\": \"Jan Hesters\",\n    \"acceptedTermsAndConditions\": true\n  }\n}\nIn your server components, you can use prisma to fetch any data.import prisma from '@/lib/prisma';\nimport {\n  Card,\n  CardContent,\n  CardHeader,\n  CardTitle,\n} from '@/components/ui/card';\n\nexport default async function Dashboard() {\n  const user = await prisma.userProfile.findUnique({\n    where: { email: 'jan@reactsquad.io' },\n  });","return (\n    <Card className=\"max-w-md mx-auto\">\n      <CardHeader>\n        <CardTitle>User Profile</Card.Title>\n      </CardHeader>\n      <CardContent>\n        {user ? (\n          <ul>\n            <li>Name: {user.name}</li>\n            <li>Email: {user.email}</li>\n          </ul>\n        ) : (\n          <p>User not found.</p>\n        )}\n      </CardContent>\n    </Card>\n  );\n}\nUse FacadesIt's a good idea to abstract away your database calls using facades. A facade is a design pattern where you provide a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.Create a file that contains all facades related to your user profile model features/user-profile/user-profile-model.ts.import { UserProfile } from '@prisma/client';\n\nimport prisma from '@/lib/prisma';","import prisma from '@/lib/prisma';\n\nexport async function retrieveUserProfileFromDatabaseByEmail(\n  email: UserProfile['email'],\n) {\n  return await prisma.userProfile.findUnique({ where: { email } });\n}\nThere are two main reasons for using facades.Increase vendor resistance - You can switch third-party providers easily. For example, you might switch from Firebase to Supabase or vice versa. Instead of updating your whole codebase to reflect the change, you only update the facade.Simplify your code - A facade can reduce the code you need to write in your application because it reduces the API to your specific application needs. Simultaneously, it makes your code easier to understand because you can give the facade descriptive names.Then use your facade in your server component.import { retrieveUserProfileFromDatabaseByEmail } from '@/features/user-profiles/user-profiles-model';\nimport {\n  Card,\n  CardContent,\n  CardHeader,\n  CardTitle,\n} from '@/components/ui/card';","export default async function Dashboard() {\n  const user =\n    await retrieveUserProfileFromDatabaseByEmail('jan@reactsquad.io');\n\n  return (\n    <Card className=\"max-w-md mx-auto\">\n      <CardHeader>\n        <CardTitle>User Profile</Card.Title>\n      </CardHeader>","<CardContent>\n        {user ? (\n          <ul>\n            <li>Name: {user.name}</li>\n            <li>Email: {user.email}</li>\n          </ul>\n        ) : (\n          <p>User not found.</p>\n        )}\n      </CardContent>\n    </Card>\n  );\n}",") : (\n          <p>User not found.</p>\n        )}\n      </CardContent>\n    </Card>\n  );\n}\nVercel PostgresYou can use Vercel Postgres for your production deployment. They have an easy to follow guide, which you can check out in the Vercel documentation. But here are the steps real quick for your convenience.To set up a database in your Vercel project, follow these steps:Go to the Storage tab and click the Create Database button.When the Browse Storage modal opens, choose Postgres and click Continue.For creating a new database:In the dialog box, type sample_postgres_db (or a name you prefer) in the Store Name field. Ensure the name has only alphanumeric characters, \"_\" or \"-\", and does not exceed 32 characters.Choose a region. For lower latency, select a region close to your function region, which is US East by default.Click Create.Then you'll need to add POSTGRES_URL_NON_POOLING to the datasource in your Prisma schema.datasource db {\n  provider  = \"postgresql\"","provider  = \"postgresql\"\n  // Uses connection pooling\n  url       = env(\"DATABASE_URL\")\n  // Uses direct connection, ‚ö†Ô∏è make sure to keep this to `POSTGRES_URL_NON_POOLING`\n  // or you'll have dangling databases from migrations\n  directUrl = env(\"POSTGRES_URL_NON_POOLING\")\n}\nVercel uses connection poolers, which manage a pool of database connections that can be reused by different parts of an application, rather than establishing a new connection for each database request. The directUrl property is used to ensure operations requiring direct database access, such as migrations, can bypass the connection pooler for reliable execution.You can get the environment variables for your Vercel database by pulling them from Vercel.vercel env pull .env","PlaywrightYou also want to use E2E tests because E2E tests give you the most confidence that your app works as intended. E2E tests are skipped far too often, but you really should make it a habit to write them. The benefits are compounding.Initialize Playwright.$ npm init playwright@latest\nGetting started with writing end-to-end tests with Playwright:\nInitializing project in '.'\n‚úî Where to put your end-to-end tests? ¬∑ playwright\n‚úî Add a GitHub Actions workflow?

requirements","Before you begin, make sure your system meets the following requirements:\n\nNode.js 18.18 or later.\nmacOS, Windows (including WSL), or Linux.\n\nAutomatic installation","Node.js 18.18 or later.\nmacOS, Windows (including WSL), or Linux.\n\nAutomatic installation\n\n\n\n\n\nThe quickest way to create a new Next.js app is using create-next-app, which sets up everything automatically for you. To create a project, run:\nTerminalnpx create-next-app@latest\nOn installation, you'll see the following prompts:\nTerminalWhat is your project named? my-app\nWould you like to use TypeScript? No / Yes\nWould you like to use ESLint? No / Yes\nWould you like to use Tailwind CSS? No / Yes\nWould you like your code inside a `src/` directory? No / Yes\nWould you like to use App Router? (recommended) No / Yes\nWould you like to use Turbopack for `next dev`?  No / Yes\nWould you like to customize the import alias (`@/*` by default)? No / Yes\nWhat import alias would you like configured? @/*\nAfter the prompts, create-next-app will create a folder with your project name and install the required dependencies.\nManual installation","To manually create a new Next.js app, install the required packages:\nTerminalnpm install next@latest react@latest react-dom@latest\nThen, add the following scripts to your package.json file:\npackage.json{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"dev\": \"next dev\",\n    \"build\": \"next build\",\n    \"start\": \"next start\",\n    \"lint\": \"next lint\"\n  }\n}\nThese scripts refer to the different stages of developing an application:\n\nnext dev: Starts the development server.\nnext build: Builds the application for production.\nnext start: Starts the production server.\nnext lint: Runs ESLint.\n\nCreate the app directory","Create the app directory\n\n\n\n\nNext.js uses file-system routing, which means the routes in your application are determined by how you structure your files.Create an app folder. Then, inside app, create a layout.tsx file. This file is the root layout. It's required and must contain the <html> and <body> tags.app/layout.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptexport default function RootLayout({\n  children,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n}) {\n  return (\n    <html lang=\"en\">\n      <body>{children}</body>\n    </html>\n  )\n}Create a home page app/page.tsx with some initial content:app/page.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptexport default function Page() {\n  return <h1>Hello, Next.js!</h1>\n}Both layout.tsx and page.tsx will be rendered when the user visits the root of your application (/).\nGood to know:","If you forget to create the root layout, Next.js will automatically create this file when running the development server with next dev.\nYou can optionally use a src folder in the root of your project to separate your application's code from configuration files.\n\n\n\nCreate the public folder (optional)\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a public folder at the root of your project to store static assets such as images, fonts, etc. Files inside public can then be referenced by your code starting from the base URL (/).\nYou can then reference these assets using the root path (/). For example, public/profile.png can be referenced as /profile.png:\napp/page.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptimport Image from 'next/image'\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  return <Image src=\"/profile.png\" alt=\"Profile\" width={100} height={100} />\n}\n\nRun the development server","Run the development server\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRun npm run dev to start the development server.\nVisit http://localhost:3000 to view your application.\nEdit theapp/page.tsx  file and save it to see the updated result in your browser.\n\nSet up TypeScript\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMinimum TypeScript version: v4.5.2\n\nNext.js comes with built-in TypeScript support. To add TypeScript to your project, rename a file to .ts / .tsx and run next dev. Next.js will automatically install the necessary dependencies and add a tsconfig.json file with the recommended config options.\nIDE Plugin\n\n\n\n\nNext.js includes a custom TypeScript plugin and type checker, which VSCode and other code editors can use for advanced type-checking and auto-completion.You can enable the plugin in VS Code by:\nOpening the command palette (Ctrl/‚åò + Shift + P)\nSearching for \"TypeScript: Select TypeScript Version\"\nSelecting \"Use Workspace Version\"\n\nSee the TypeScript reference page for more information.\nSet up ESLint","See the TypeScript reference page for more information.\nSet up ESLint\n\n\n\n\n\nNext.js comes with built-in ESLint. It automatically installs the necessary packages and configures the proper settings when you create a new project with create-next-app.\nTo manually add ESLint to an existing project, add next lint as a script to package.json:\npackage.json{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"lint\": \"next lint\"\n  }\n}\nThen, run npm run lint and you will be guided through the installation and configuration process.\nTerminalnpm run lint\nYou'll see a prompt like this:\n\n? How would you like to configure ESLint?\n‚ùØ Strict (recommended)\nBase\nCancel\n\n\nStrict: Includes Next.js' base ESLint configuration along with a stricter Core Web Vitals rule-set. This is the recommended configuration for developers setting up ESLint for the first time.\nBase: Includes Next.js' base ESLint configuration.\nCancel: Skip configuration. Select this option if you plan on setting up your own custom ESLint configuration.","If Strict or Base are selected, Next.js will automatically install eslint and eslint-config-next as dependencies in your application and create an .eslintrc.json file in the root of your project that includes your selected configuration.\nYou can now run next lint every time you want to run ESLint to catch errors. Once ESLint has been set up, it will also automatically run during every build (next build). Errors will fail the build, while warnings will not.\nSee the ESLint Plugin page for more information.\nSet up Absolute Imports and Module Path Aliases","Next.js has in-built support for the \"paths\" and \"baseUrl\" options of tsconfig.json and jsconfig.json files.\nThese options allow you to alias project directories to absolute paths, making it easier and cleaner to import modules. For example:\n// Before\nimport { Button } from '../../../components/button'\n \n// After\nimport { Button } from '@/components/button'\nTo configure absolute imports, add the baseUrl configuration option to your tsconfig.json or jsconfig.json file. For example:\ntsconfig.json or jsconfig.json{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"baseUrl\": \"src/\"\n  }\n}\nIn addition to configuring the baseUrl path, you can use the \"paths\" option to \"alias\" module paths.\nFor example, the following configuration maps @/components/* to components/*:\ntsconfig.json or jsconfig.json{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"baseUrl\": \"src/\",\n    \"paths\": {\n      \"@/styles/*\": [\"styles/*\"],\n      \"@/components/*\": [\"components/*\"]\n    }\n  }\n}","\"@/styles/*\": [\"styles/*\"],\n      \"@/components/*\": [\"components/*\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\nEach of the \"paths\" are relative to the baseUrl location.PreviousGetting StartedNextProject StructureWas this helpful?","supported.Send\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResourcesDocsSupport

One way we can achieve this gem is by using quality web-building tools like NextJS- to enhance web performance such as lazy-image loading, Typescript- to keep code quality and avoid future spills and ChakraUI- to build accessibly user-friend interfaces. \nThis article will be working us through how we can combine these ‚Äúpowers‚Äù to build a ‚Äúsuperpowered‚Äù web application\nStep One- Initiate NextJS with Typescript: (Docs)\nIn our terminal, navigate to a directory to create a new project. Using your preferred package manager, let‚Äôs create a React project powered with NextJS and Typescript using this command: \nyarn create next-app --typescript or npx create-next-app@latest --ts. \nIn the process of running this command, the terminal will pop up a dialog asking us to name our new project. Let‚Äôs call it doggies (A Dog-interest website) and we are golden!","PS: The --ts or --typescript is a flag to tell the package manager to initiate a React project with Typescript.","Step Two- Install ChakraUI: (Docs)\nAfter successfully creating our project that is powered with NextJS and Typescript, let‚Äôs now install ChakraUI. Before running the command to install ChakraUI, navigate to the root of the project, then go ahead to install ChakraUI using this command: \nyarn add @chakra-ui/react @emotion/react@^11 @emotion/styled@^11 framer-motion@^6\nor\nnpm i @chakra-ui/react @emotion/react@^11 @emotion/styled@^11 framer-motion@^6 \nAnd that‚Äôs it! ChakraUI is now available on our project. To have full access to the goodies that comes with ChakraUI we need to do one last thing and that takes us to step number 3.\n\n\nStep Three- Activate the power of ChakraUI.\nTo do this, we need to access the _app.tsx file inside our Pages folder of our project and wrap its return components in a ChakraProvider Component. \nThis is what the file looks like by default:\n\n\nimport type { AppProps } from 'next/app'","import type { AppProps } from 'next/app'\n\nfunction MyApp({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) {\n  return <Component {...pageProps} />\n}\n\nexport default MyApp\n\n\n\nEnter fullscreen mode\n\n\nExit fullscreen mode\n\n\n\n\n\nSo now let‚Äôs import ChakraProvider and use it as a wrapper before returning the Components. Our file should now look like this:\n\n\nimport '../styles/globals.css'\nimport type { AppProps } from 'next/app'\nimport { ChakraProvider } from '@chakra-ui/react'\n\nfunction MyApp({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) {\n  return (\n    <ChakraProvider>\n      <Component {...pageProps} />\n    </ChakraProvider>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default MyApp;\n\n\n\nEnter fullscreen mode\n\n\nExit fullscreen mode","export default MyApp;\n\n\n\nEnter fullscreen mode\n\n\nExit fullscreen mode\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd there it is! Our application is now powered with NextJS, Typescript and ChakraUI. \nTo see the smooth user interfaces your can create with ChakraUI you can check the documentation of all its components here. \nI‚Äôll be writing an article about why this setup is my favourite and what opportunities this gives us, until then, have a good day and stay well!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Top comments (1)\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonal\nTrusted User\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Create template\n      \nTemplates let you quickly answer FAQs or store snippets for re-use.\n\n\n\nSubmit\nPreview\nDismiss\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCollapse\n\n\nExpand\n\n\n\n\n\n\n¬†\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInfo\n\n\n\n      Comment hidden by post author - thread only accessible via permalink\n  \n\n\nDustinSeals\n\n\n\n      DustinSeals\n      \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      DustinSeals\n      \n    \n\n\n\nFollow","DustinSeals\n\n\n\n      DustinSeals\n      \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      DustinSeals\n      \n    \n\n\n\nFollow\n\n\n    I am Dustin .

For example if the user sets their computer to dark mode by default, Chakra-UI will default to dark mode.\nComposibility: Components can be created from the Chakra-UI ones or if needed custom components can be created with ease.\nTypescript Support: Chakra-UI is written in TypeScript and provides class types for easy integration.\n\n\n\n\n\n  What we will be making\n\nIn this tutorial we will use Chakra-UI to create a simple user list/profile page. \nWe will also integrate a toggler to toggle between light and dark mode.\nYou will learn how to set up a basic Next.js application with Chakra-UI integration.\n\n\n\n\n  Creating the Next.js application and installing the dependencies","Creating the Next.js application and installing the dependencies\n\nFirst we need to create a new Next.js app and install the dependencies needed for the example.\nThe Next.js app can be created via the following command:\n\n\n\nnpx create-next-app@latest\n\n\n\n\n\nEnter fullscreen mode\n\n\nExit fullscreen mode\n\n\n\n\n\nThis will set up the Next.js project automatically for you.\nNext we need to install Chakra-ui which can be done via the following command:\n\n\n\nyarn add @chakra-ui/react @emotion/react@^11 @emotion/styled@^11 framer-motion@^4 @chakra-ui/icons\n\n\n\n\n\nEnter fullscreen mode\n\n\nExit fullscreen mode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Creating fake Users\n\nNext we will need some fake users to actually populate the page. \nCreate a \"data\" folder in the root directory and create a \"users.js\" file and populate it with the following data: (feel free to use your own custom data but be careful of the parameter names):\nhttps://github.com/ethand91/nextjs-chakra-sample/blob/main/data/users.js\n\n\n\n\n  Creating the components","Creating the components\n\nNext we need to create the components needed for the sample page, create a new folder called \"components\" and within that create a \"TopBar\" folder.\nWithin the TopBar folder create a new file called \"index.js\" and populate it with the following contents:\n\n\n\nimport {\n  Box,\n  Button,\n  useColorMode\n} from '@chakra-ui/react';\nimport { MoonIcon, SunIcon } from '@chakra-ui/icons';\n\nfunction TopBar() {\n  const { colorMode, toggleColorMode } = useColorMode();\n  const ColorModeIcon = colorMode === 'light' ? SunIcon : MoonIcon;\n\n  return (\n    <Box width=\"100%\" padding=\"1\" backgroundColor=\"purple.700\">\n      <Box maxWidth=\"container.xl\" margin=\"auto\">\n        <Button\n          aria-label=\"ui theme\"\n          leftIcon={ <ColorModeIcon /> }\n          onClick={ toggleColorMode }\n          size=\"xs\"\n          marginRight=\"2\"\n          borderRadius=\"sm\"\n        >\n          Toggle Theme\n        </Button>\n      </Box>\n    </Box>\n  );  \n};\n\nexport default TopBar;","export default TopBar;\n\n\n\n\n\nEnter fullscreen mode\n\n\nExit fullscreen mode\n\n\n\n\n\nHere we create a simple top bar for the application, we give it a background color of purple and also provide a button that allows the user to toggle between light/dark mode using Chakra-UI.\nNext we need a component to display the users, so create a new \"UserCard\" directory and within that directory create an \"index.js\" file and populate it with the following contents:\n\n\n\nimport Link from 'next/link';\nimport {\n  Box,\n  Text,\n  Avatar,\n  Center,\n  VStack,\n  useColorModeValue\n} from '@chakra-ui/react';","function UserCard(props) {\n  return (\n    <Link href={ `/users/${props.username}` } passHref>\n      <VStack\n        spacing=\"4\"\n        borderRadius=\"md\"\n        boxShadow=\"x1\"\n        padding=\"5\"\n        backgroundColor={\n          useColorModeValue('gray.50', 'gray.700')\n        }\n      >   \n        <Center>\n          <Avatar size=\"lg\" src={ props.avatar } />\n        </Center>\n        <Center>\n          <Box textAlign=\"center\">\n            <Text fontWeight=\"bold\" fontSize=\"xl\">\n              { props.first_name } { props.last_name }\n            </Text>\n            <Text fontSize=\"xs\">{ props.job_title }</Text>\n          </Box>\n        </Center>\n      </VStack>\n    </Link>\n  );  \n};\n\nexport default UserCard;\n\n\n\n\n\nEnter fullscreen mode\n\n\nExit fullscreen mode\n\n\n\n\n\nThis card will link to the user details page, using Chakra-UI we are easily able to center contents using \"Center\". We also use Avatar to easily display the user's profile picture.\nThats the components created.","Creating the Pages\n\nNext we need to start working on the pages.\nWe will be overriding the default Next.js document which can be done by creating a \"_document.js\" inside the pages directory. \nCreate the file and populate it with the following:\n\n\n\nimport { ColorModeScript } from '@chakra-ui/react';\nimport NextDocument, {\n  Html,\n  Head,\n  Main,\n  NextScript\n} from 'next/document';\nimport { extendTheme } from '@chakra-ui/react';\n\nconst config = { \n  useSystemColorMode: true\n};\n\nconst theme = extendTheme({ config }); \n\nexport default class Document extends NextDocument {\n  render () {\n    return (\n      <Html lang=\"en\">\n        <Head />\n        <body>\n          <ColorModeScript\n            initialColorMode={ theme.config.initialColorMode }\n          />\n          <Main />\n          <NextScript />\n        </body>\n      </Html>\n    );  \n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nEnter fullscreen mode\n\n\nExit fullscreen mode","Enter fullscreen mode\n\n\nExit fullscreen mode\n\n\n\n\n\nThe reason for overriding the default layout is because we want to apply both light/dark theme to the entire page.\nNext we need to apply Chara-UI to the application so open up pages/_app.js and change the contents to the following:\n\n\n\nimport { ChakraProvider, Box } from '@chakra-ui/react';\nimport TopBar from './../components/TopBar';\n\nfunction MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {\n  return (\n    <ChakraProvider>\n      <TopBar />\n      <Box maxWidth=\"container.xl\" margin=\"auto\">\n        <Component { ...pageProps} />\n      </Box>\n    </ChakraProvider>\n  );  \n}\n\nexport default MyApp\n\n\n\n\n\nEnter fullscreen mode\n\n\nExit fullscreen mode\n\n\n\n\n\nHere we bascially tell Next.js to use the Chara-UI provider and make sure everypage has our custom TopBar.\nNext we need to edit the pages/index.js to contain the following contents:\n\n\n\nimport {\n  Box,\n  Grid,\n  Text,\n  GridItem\n} from '@chakra-ui/react';","import {\n  Box,\n  Grid,\n  Text,\n  GridItem\n} from '@chakra-ui/react';\n\nimport UserCard from './../components/UserCard';\nimport users from './../data/users';\n\nexport default function Home() {\n  return (\n    <Box>\n      <Text\n        fontSize=\"xxx-large\"\n        fontWeight=\"extrabold\"\n        textAlign=\"center\"\n        marginTop=\"9\"\n      >   \n        Users\n      </Text>\n\n      <Grid\n        gridTemplateColumns={ ['1fr', 'repeat(2, 1fr)', 'repeat(3, 1fr)'] }\n        gridGap=\"10\"\n        padding=\"10\"\n      >   \n        {\n          users.map((user) => (\n            <GridItem key={ user.id }>\n              <UserCard { ...user } />\n            </GridItem>\n          ))\n        }\n      </Grid>\n    </Box>\n  );  \n}\n\n\n\n\n\nEnter fullscreen mode\n\n\nExit fullscreen mode","Enter fullscreen mode\n\n\nExit fullscreen mode\n\n\n\n\n\nHere we basically list all the users using Chakra-UI's Grid component. The \"gridTemplateColumns\" allows us to set the sizes for small screens, medium screens and large screens. For example if you view the page on a large screen each row will have 3 users, however if you view it on a mobile device each row will only have one user.\nFeel free to run the project using:\n\n\n\nnpm run dev\n\n\n\n\n\nEnter fullscreen mode\n\n\nExit fullscreen mode\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you access the page (https://localhost:3000), you should see the following page:\n\nIf you prefer light mode you should see the following:","If you prefer light mode you should see the following:\n\nFeel free to play with the toggle button. If you try clicking on a user you will be greeted with a 404 not found response so let's create the user profile page!\nCreate a \"users\" folder inside the pages folder and create the \"[username].js\". (Note if you're using a terminal like me you may need to escape the brackets with a backslash).\nNow fill the file with the following contents:\n\n\n\nmport Link from 'next/link';\nimport {\n  Avatar,\n  Box,\n  Center,\n  Text,\n  Image,\n  Button,\n  Flex,\n  useColorModeValue\n} from '@chakra-ui/react';\n\nimport users from './../../data/users';\n\nexport function getStaticPaths() {\n  const paths = users.map((user) => ({\n    params: {\n      username: user.username\n    }   \n  }));\n\n  return {\n    paths,\n    fallback: false\n  };  \n}\n\nexport function getStaticProps({ params }) {\n  const { username } = params;","export function getStaticProps({ params }) {\n  const { username } = params;\n\n  return { \n    props: {\n      user: users.find((user) => user.username === username)\n    }   \n  };  \n};\n\nfunction UserPage({ user }) {\n  return (\n    <Center\n      marginTop={ ['0', '0', '8' ] }\n      boxShadow=\"lg\"\n      minHeight=\"fit-content\"\n    >\n      <Box>\n        <Box position=\"relative\">\n          <Image src={user.cover_image} width=\"fit-content\" height=\"250px\" objectFit=\"cover\" />\n\n          <Flex\n            alignItems=\"flex-end\"\n            position=\"absolute\"\n            top=\"0\"\n            left=\"0\"\n            backgroundColor={\n              useColorModeValue('blackAlpha.400', 'blackAlpha.600')\n            }\n            width=\"100%\"\n            height=\"100%\"\n            padding=\"8\"\n            color=\"white\"","<Avatar size=\"lg\" src={ user.avatar } />\n            <Box marginLeft=\"6\">\n              <Text as=\"h1\" fontSize=\"xx-large\" fontWeight=\"bold\">\n                { user.first_name } { user.last_name }\n              </Text>\n              <Text as=\"p\" fontSize=\"large\" lineHeight=\"1.5\">\n                { user.job_title }\n              </Text>\n            </Box>\n          </Flex>\n        </Box>\n        <Box\n          maxW=\"container.xl\"\n          margin=\"auto\"\n          padding=\"8\"\n          backgroundColor={\n            useColorModeValue('white', 'gray.700')\n          }\n        >\n          <Text as=\"p\">{ user.description }</Text>\n          <Link href=\"/\" passHref>\n            <Button marginTop=\"8\" colorScheme=\"whatsapp\" as=\"a\">\n              Back to all users\n            </Button>\n          </Link>\n        </Box>\n      </Box>\n    </Center>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default UserPage;\n\n\n\n\n\nEnter fullscreen mode\n\n\nExit fullscreen mode","export default UserPage;\n\n\n\n\n\nEnter fullscreen mode\n\n\nExit fullscreen mode\n\n\n\n\n\nPhew! Here we use \"getStaticPaths\" to tell Next.js we need to render a new page for each user in the user's array.\nWe also tell Next.js to display the default 404 page if the requested user is not found.\nChakra-UI allows us to easily center the contents. This page basically displays the contents of the user and provides a button to go back using a Chakra-UI feature.\nAll done fire up the dev server and load up https://localhost:3000 in the browser. \nOnce loading try clicking on a user you should see the following page:\n\n\nAll done! üòé\n\n\n\n\n  Conclusion\n\nHere I have demonstrated how to use Next.js with Chakra-UI.

‚ÄúFast, disk space efficient package manager‚Äù. Apart from being fast, up to 2x faster than other package managers (see benchmarks), and space efficient, it also has a version manager baked in.Add out-of-the-box monorepo support i.e. support for multiple packages in the same project, cross-platform reliability, and checksum and integrity testing to handle security (cough NPM bad package vulnerabilities cough), and you have a package manager rapidly winning the hearts of JS developers everywhere.PNPM is actively used in production by big companies like ByteDance, Vercel, Microsoft,","everywhere.PNPM is actively used in production by big companies like ByteDance, Vercel, Microsoft, Prezi, and JustAnswer, just to name a few ‚Äî it has been production-ready for more than 6 years now.In this first article in the Next-PNPM series, we will be looking at how we can create a NextJS app using PNPM, and how we can fully use this powerful package manager to power your next Next application.NextJS x PNPM seriesInstalling PNPMFirst, install PNPM in case you haven‚Äôt already.$ npm i -g pnpmVerify installation using pnpm --version .Using The Create ToolTo create a Next app with PNPM, we will be using the create CLI tool(see docs) that PNPM provides us. This is similar to the create utility in yarn. It can be used to create a project from create-* or @foo/create-* starter kits, like create-react-app or create-next-app .Now, create a NextJS project using pnpm using the command:$ pnpm create next-app new-next-appTo create a project with Typescript, run:$ pnpm create next-app","pnpm create next-app new-next-appTo create a project with Typescript, run:$ pnpm create next-app ts-next-app --template typescriptThis will create a new new-next-app / ts-next-app project directory where your Next application is housed.PNPM creates a pnpm-lock.yaml file to store the dependency tree which is similar to package-lock.json or yarn.lock that are created by npm and yarn.Running Project and Project ScriptsNow that you have a project created, cd into the project. You can run pnpm run dev to run the development server.$ cd new-next-app$ pnpm run devSimilarly, you also run project scripts just the way you would with npm. You can also define your own scripts inside the package.json file and run it with npm the same way you would with plain npm .And‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs it! You can now successfully use PNPM to manage your project packages and dependencies, and take advantage of the blazing-fast downloads, security, and monorepo support it has to offer ‚Äî all without tearing a hole in your hard","downloads, security, and monorepo support it has to offer ‚Äî all without tearing a hole in your hard drive.In the next article in this series, we will be looking at how we can migrate an existing Next project from npm or yarn to pnpm, and manage mono repo using pnpm ‚Äî so stay tuned!NextjsFront End DevelopmentPnpmReactFrontend----FollowPublished in readytowork, Inc.89 Followers¬∑Last published¬†6 days agoCollaborating to incorporate latest trends & technologies in products & services to serve betterFollowFollowWritten by Rojan Rajbhandari22 Followers¬∑2 FollowingSoftware Engineer and Writer.

For example if the user sets their computer to dark mode by default, Chakra-UI will default to dark mode.\nComposibility: Components can be created from the Chakra-UI ones or if needed custom components can be created with ease.\nTypescript Support: Chakra-UI is written in TypeScript and provides class types for easy integration.\n\n\n\n\n\n  What we will be making\n\nIn this tutorial we will use Chakra-UI to create a simple user list/profile page. \nWe will also integrate a toggler to toggle between light and dark mode.\nYou will learn how to set up a basic Next.js application with Chakra-UI integration.\n\n\n\n\n  Creating the Next.js application and installing the dependencies","Creating the Next.js application and installing the dependencies\n\nFirst we need to create a new Next.js app and install the dependencies needed for the example.\nThe Next.js app can be created via the following command:\n\n\n\nnpx create-next-app@latest\n\n\n\n\n\nEnter fullscreen mode\n\n\nExit fullscreen mode\n\n\n\n\n\nThis will set up the Next.js project automatically for you.\nNext we need to install Chakra-ui which can be done via the following command:\n\n\n\nyarn add @chakra-ui/react @emotion/react@^11 @emotion/styled@^11 framer-motion@^4 @chakra-ui/icons\n\n\n\n\n\nEnter fullscreen mode\n\n\nExit fullscreen mode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Creating fake Users\n\nNext we will need some fake users to actually populate the page. \nCreate a \"data\" folder in the root directory and create a \"users.js\" file and populate it with the following data: (feel free to use your own custom data but be careful of the parameter names):\nhttps://github.com/ethand91/nextjs-chakra-sample/blob/main/data/users.js\n\n\n\n\n  Creating the components","Creating the components\n\nNext we need to create the components needed for the sample page, create a new folder called \"components\" and within that create a \"TopBar\" folder.\nWithin the TopBar folder create a new file called \"index.js\" and populate it with the following contents:\n\n\n\nimport {\n  Box,\n  Button,\n  useColorMode\n} from '@chakra-ui/react';\nimport { MoonIcon, SunIcon } from '@chakra-ui/icons';\n\nfunction TopBar() {\n  const { colorMode, toggleColorMode } = useColorMode();\n  const ColorModeIcon = colorMode === 'light' ? SunIcon : MoonIcon;\n\n  return (\n    <Box width=\"100%\" padding=\"1\" backgroundColor=\"purple.700\">\n      <Box maxWidth=\"container.xl\" margin=\"auto\">\n        <Button\n          aria-label=\"ui theme\"\n          leftIcon={ <ColorModeIcon /> }\n          onClick={ toggleColorMode }\n          size=\"xs\"\n          marginRight=\"2\"\n          borderRadius=\"sm\"\n        >\n          Toggle Theme\n        </Button>\n      </Box>\n    </Box>\n  );  \n};\n\nexport default TopBar;","export default TopBar;\n\n\n\n\n\nEnter fullscreen mode\n\n\nExit fullscreen mode\n\n\n\n\n\nHere we create a simple top bar for the application, we give it a background color of purple and also provide a button that allows the user to toggle between light/dark mode using Chakra-UI.\nNext we need a component to display the users, so create a new \"UserCard\" directory and within that directory create an \"index.js\" file and populate it with the following contents:\n\n\n\nimport Link from 'next/link';\nimport {\n  Box,\n  Text,\n  Avatar,\n  Center,\n  VStack,\n  useColorModeValue\n} from '@chakra-ui/react';","function UserCard(props) {\n  return (\n    <Link href={ `/users/${props.username}` } passHref>\n      <VStack\n        spacing=\"4\"\n        borderRadius=\"md\"\n        boxShadow=\"x1\"\n        padding=\"5\"\n        backgroundColor={\n          useColorModeValue('gray.50', 'gray.700')\n        }\n      >   \n        <Center>\n          <Avatar size=\"lg\" src={ props.avatar } />\n        </Center>\n        <Center>\n          <Box textAlign=\"center\">\n            <Text fontWeight=\"bold\" fontSize=\"xl\">\n              { props.first_name } { props.last_name }\n            </Text>\n            <Text fontSize=\"xs\">{ props.job_title }</Text>\n          </Box>\n        </Center>\n      </VStack>\n    </Link>\n  );  \n};\n\nexport default UserCard;\n\n\n\n\n\nEnter fullscreen mode\n\n\nExit fullscreen mode\n\n\n\n\n\nThis card will link to the user details page, using Chakra-UI we are easily able to center contents using \"Center\". We also use Avatar to easily display the user's profile picture.\nThats the components created.","Creating the Pages\n\nNext we need to start working on the pages.\nWe will be overriding the default Next.js document which can be done by creating a \"_document.js\" inside the pages directory. \nCreate the file and populate it with the following:\n\n\n\nimport { ColorModeScript } from '@chakra-ui/react';\nimport NextDocument, {\n  Html,\n  Head,\n  Main,\n  NextScript\n} from 'next/document';\nimport { extendTheme } from '@chakra-ui/react';\n\nconst config = { \n  useSystemColorMode: true\n};\n\nconst theme = extendTheme({ config }); \n\nexport default class Document extends NextDocument {\n  render () {\n    return (\n      <Html lang=\"en\">\n        <Head />\n        <body>\n          <ColorModeScript\n            initialColorMode={ theme.config.initialColorMode }\n          />\n          <Main />\n          <NextScript />\n        </body>\n      </Html>\n    );  \n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nEnter fullscreen mode\n\n\nExit fullscreen mode","Enter fullscreen mode\n\n\nExit fullscreen mode\n\n\n\n\n\nThe reason for overriding the default layout is because we want to apply both light/dark theme to the entire page.\nNext we need to apply Chara-UI to the application so open up pages/_app.js and change the contents to the following:\n\n\n\nimport { ChakraProvider, Box } from '@chakra-ui/react';\nimport TopBar from './../components/TopBar';\n\nfunction MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {\n  return (\n    <ChakraProvider>\n      <TopBar />\n      <Box maxWidth=\"container.xl\" margin=\"auto\">\n        <Component { ...pageProps} />\n      </Box>\n    </ChakraProvider>\n  );  \n}\n\nexport default MyApp\n\n\n\n\n\nEnter fullscreen mode\n\n\nExit fullscreen mode\n\n\n\n\n\nHere we bascially tell Next.js to use the Chara-UI provider and make sure everypage has our custom TopBar.\nNext we need to edit the pages/index.js to contain the following contents:\n\n\n\nimport {\n  Box,\n  Grid,\n  Text,\n  GridItem\n} from '@chakra-ui/react';","import {\n  Box,\n  Grid,\n  Text,\n  GridItem\n} from '@chakra-ui/react';\n\nimport UserCard from './../components/UserCard';\nimport users from './../data/users';\n\nexport default function Home() {\n  return (\n    <Box>\n      <Text\n        fontSize=\"xxx-large\"\n        fontWeight=\"extrabold\"\n        textAlign=\"center\"\n        marginTop=\"9\"\n      >   \n        Users\n      </Text>\n\n      <Grid\n        gridTemplateColumns={ ['1fr', 'repeat(2, 1fr)', 'repeat(3, 1fr)'] }\n        gridGap=\"10\"\n        padding=\"10\"\n      >   \n        {\n          users.map((user) => (\n            <GridItem key={ user.id }>\n              <UserCard { ...user } />\n            </GridItem>\n          ))\n        }\n      </Grid>\n    </Box>\n  );  \n}\n\n\n\n\n\nEnter fullscreen mode\n\n\nExit fullscreen mode","Enter fullscreen mode\n\n\nExit fullscreen mode\n\n\n\n\n\nHere we basically list all the users using Chakra-UI's Grid component. The \"gridTemplateColumns\" allows us to set the sizes for small screens, medium screens and large screens. For example if you view the page on a large screen each row will have 3 users, however if you view it on a mobile device each row will only have one user.\nFeel free to run the project using:\n\n\n\nnpm run dev\n\n\n\n\n\nEnter fullscreen mode\n\n\nExit fullscreen mode\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you access the page (https://localhost:3000), you should see the following page:\n\nIf you prefer light mode you should see the following:","If you prefer light mode you should see the following:\n\nFeel free to play with the toggle button. If you try clicking on a user you will be greeted with a 404 not found response so let's create the user profile page!\nCreate a \"users\" folder inside the pages folder and create the \"[username].js\". (Note if you're using a terminal like me you may need to escape the brackets with a backslash).\nNow fill the file with the following contents:\n\n\n\nmport Link from 'next/link';\nimport {\n  Avatar,\n  Box,\n  Center,\n  Text,\n  Image,\n  Button,\n  Flex,\n  useColorModeValue\n} from '@chakra-ui/react';\n\nimport users from './../../data/users';\n\nexport function getStaticPaths() {\n  const paths = users.map((user) => ({\n    params: {\n      username: user.username\n    }   \n  }));\n\n  return {\n    paths,\n    fallback: false\n  };  \n}\n\nexport function getStaticProps({ params }) {\n  const { username } = params;","export function getStaticProps({ params }) {\n  const { username } = params;\n\n  return { \n    props: {\n      user: users.find((user) => user.username === username)\n    }   \n  };  \n};\n\nfunction UserPage({ user }) {\n  return (\n    <Center\n      marginTop={ ['0', '0', '8' ] }\n      boxShadow=\"lg\"\n      minHeight=\"fit-content\"\n    >\n      <Box>\n        <Box position=\"relative\">\n          <Image src={user.cover_image} width=\"fit-content\" height=\"250px\" objectFit=\"cover\" />\n\n          <Flex\n            alignItems=\"flex-end\"\n            position=\"absolute\"\n            top=\"0\"\n            left=\"0\"\n            backgroundColor={\n              useColorModeValue('blackAlpha.400', 'blackAlpha.600')\n            }\n            width=\"100%\"\n            height=\"100%\"\n            padding=\"8\"\n            color=\"white\"","<Avatar size=\"lg\" src={ user.avatar } />\n            <Box marginLeft=\"6\">\n              <Text as=\"h1\" fontSize=\"xx-large\" fontWeight=\"bold\">\n                { user.first_name } { user.last_name }\n              </Text>\n              <Text as=\"p\" fontSize=\"large\" lineHeight=\"1.5\">\n                { user.job_title }\n              </Text>\n            </Box>\n          </Flex>\n        </Box>\n        <Box\n          maxW=\"container.xl\"\n          margin=\"auto\"\n          padding=\"8\"\n          backgroundColor={\n            useColorModeValue('white', 'gray.700')\n          }\n        >\n          <Text as=\"p\">{ user.description }</Text>\n          <Link href=\"/\" passHref>\n            <Button marginTop=\"8\" colorScheme=\"whatsapp\" as=\"a\">\n              Back to all users\n            </Button>\n          </Link>\n        </Box>\n      </Box>\n    </Center>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default UserPage;\n\n\n\n\n\nEnter fullscreen mode\n\n\nExit fullscreen mode","export default UserPage;\n\n\n\n\n\nEnter fullscreen mode\n\n\nExit fullscreen mode\n\n\n\n\n\nPhew! Here we use \"getStaticPaths\" to tell Next.js we need to render a new page for each user in the user's array.\nWe also tell Next.js to display the default 404 page if the requested user is not found.\nChakra-UI allows us to easily center the contents.

It includes:","üîÄ Routing\nüñº Image optimization\n‚§µÔ∏è Absolute imports\nüé® Styling\nüéõ Webpack & Babel config\nüí´ and more!\n\nRequirements\n\nNext.js ‚â• 13.5\nStorybook ‚â• 7.0\n\nGetting started\nIn a project without Storybook\nFollow the prompts after running this command in your Next.js project's root directory:\n\n npmnpm create storybook@latest\n\nMore on getting started with Storybook.\nIn a project with Storybook\nThis framework is designed to work with Storybook 7+. If you‚Äôre not already using v7, upgrade with this command:\n\n npmnpx storybook@latest upgrade\n\nAutomatic migration\nWhen running the upgrade command above, you should get a prompt asking you to migrate to @storybook/nextjs, which should handle everything for you. In case that auto-migration does not work for your project, refer to the manual migration below.\nManual migration\nFirst, install the framework:\n\n npmnpm install --save-dev @storybook/nextjs\n\nThen, update your .storybook/main.js|ts to change the framework property:","Then, update your .storybook/main.js|ts to change the framework property:\n\n .storybook/main.tsTypescriptimport { StorybookConfig } from '@storybook/nextjs';\n \nconst config: StorybookConfig = {\n  // ...\n  // framework: '@storybook/react-webpack5', üëà Remove this\n  framework: '@storybook/nextjs', // üëà Add this\n};\n \nexport default config;\n\nFinally, if you were using Storybook plugins to integrate with Next.js, those are no longer necessary when using this framework and can be removed:\n\n .storybook/main.tsTypescriptimport { StorybookConfig } from '@storybook/nextjs';\n \nconst config: StorybookConfig = {\n  // ...\n  addons: [\n    // ...\n    // üëá These can both be removed\n    // 'storybook-addon-next',\n    // 'storybook-addon-next-router',\n  ],\n};\n \nexport default config;","With Vite\n(‚ö†Ô∏è Experimental)\nYou can use our freshly baked, experimental @storybook/experimental-nextjs-vite framework, which is based on Vite and removes the need for Webpack and Babel. It supports all of the features documented here.\n‚ÑπÔ∏èUsing the Next.js framework with Vite requires Next.js 14.1.0 or later.\n\n npmnpm install --save-dev @storybook/experimental-nextjs-vite\n\nThen, update your .storybook/main.js|ts to change the framework property:\n\n .storybook/main.tsTypescriptimport { StorybookConfig } from '@storybook/experimental-nextjs-vite';\n \nconst config: StorybookConfig = {\n  // ...\n  // framework: '@storybook/react-webpack5', üëà Remove this\n  framework: '@storybook/experimental-nextjs-vite', // üëà Add this\n};\n \nexport default config;","‚ÑπÔ∏èIf your Storybook configuration contains custom Webpack operations in webpackFinal, you will likely need to create equivalents in viteFinal.For more information, see the Vite builder documentation.\nFinally, if you were using Storybook plugins to integrate with Next.js, those are no longer necessary when using this framework and can be removed:\n\n .storybook/main.tsTypescriptimport { StorybookConfig } from '@storybook/experimental-nextjs-vite';\n \nconst config: StorybookConfig = {\n  // ...\n  addons: [\n    // ...\n    // üëá These can both be removed\n    // 'storybook-addon-next',\n    // 'storybook-addon-next-router',\n  ],\n};\n \nexport default config;\n\nRun the Setup Wizard\nIf all goes well, you should see a setup wizard that will help you get started with Storybook introducing you to the main concepts and features, including how the UI is organized, how to write your first story, and how to test your components' response to various inputs utilizing controls.","If you skipped the wizard, you can always run it again by adding the ?path=/onboarding query parameter to the URL of your Storybook instance, provided that the example stories are still available.\nNext.js's Image component\nThis framework allows you to use Next.js's next/image with no configuration.\nLocal images\nLocal images are supported.\n // index.jsx\nimport Image from 'next/image';\nimport profilePic from '../public/me.png';\n \nfunction Home() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <h1>My Homepage</h1>\n      <Image\n        src={profilePic}\n        alt=\"Picture of the author\"\n        // width={500} automatically provided\n        // height={500} automatically provided\n        // blurDataURL=\"../public/me.png\" set to equal the image itself (for this framework)\n        // placeholder=\"blur\" // Optional blur-up while loading\n      />\n      <p>Welcome to my homepage!</p>\n    </>\n  );\n}\nRemote images\nRemote images are also supported.\n // index.jsx\nimport Image from 'next/image';","}\nRemote images\nRemote images are also supported.\n // index.jsx\nimport Image from 'next/image';\n \nexport default function Home() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <h1>My Homepage</h1>\n      <Image src=\"/me.png\" alt=\"Picture of the author\" width={500} height={500} />\n      <p>Welcome to my homepage!</p>\n    </>\n  );\n}\nNext.js font optimization\nnext/font is partially supported in Storybook. The packages next/font/google and next/font/local are supported.\nnext/font/google\nYou don't have to do anything. next/font/google is supported out of the box.\nnext/font/local\nFor local fonts you have to define the src property.\nThe path is relative to the directory where the font loader function is called.\nIf the following component defines your localFont like this:\n // src/components/MyComponent.js\nimport localFont from 'next/font/local';\n \nconst localRubikStorm = localFont({ src: './fonts/RubikStorm-Regular.ttf' });\nstaticDir mapping","const localRubikStorm = localFont({ src: './fonts/RubikStorm-Regular.ttf' });\nstaticDir mapping\n‚ÑπÔ∏èYou can safely skip this section if you are using @storybook/experimental-nextjs-vite instead of @storybook/nextjs. The Vite-based framework takes care of the mapping automatically.\nYou have to tell Storybook where the fonts directory is located, via the staticDirs configuration. The from value is relative to the .storybook directory. The to value is relative to the execution context of Storybook. Very likely it is the root of your project.",".storybook/main.tsTypescriptimport { StorybookConfig } from '@storybook/nextjs';\n \nconst config: StorybookConfig = {\n  // ...\n  staticDirs: [\n    {\n      from: '../src/components/fonts',\n      to: 'src/components/fonts',\n    },\n  ],\n};\n \nexport default config;\n\nNot supported features of next/font\nThe following features are not supported (yet). Support for these features might be planned for the future:\n\nSupport font loaders configuration in next.config.js\nfallback option\nadjustFontFallback option\npreload option gets ignored. Storybook handles Font loading its own way.\ndisplay option gets ignored. All fonts are loaded with display set to \"block\" to make Storybook load the font properly.","Mocking fonts during testing\nOccasionally fetching fonts from Google may fail as part of your Storybook build step. It is highly recommended to mock these requests, as those failures can cause your pipeline to fail as well. Next.js supports mocking fonts via a JavaScript module located where the env var NEXT_FONT_GOOGLE_MOCKED_RESPONSES references.\nFor example, using GitHub Actions:\n # .github/workflows/ci.yml\n- uses: chromaui/action@v1\n  env:\n    #üëá the location of mocked fonts to use\n    NEXT_FONT_GOOGLE_MOCKED_RESPONSES: ${{ github.workspace }}/mocked-google-fonts.js\n  with:\n    projectToken: ${{ secrets.CHROMATIC_PROJECT_TOKEN }}\n    token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\nYour mocked fonts will look something like this:\n // mocked-google-fonts.js\n//üëá Mocked responses of google fonts with the URL as the key\nmodule.exports = {\n  'https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Inter:wght@400;500;600;800&display=block': `\n    /* cyrillic-ext */\n    @font-face {\n      font-family: 'Inter';","/* cyrillic-ext */\n    @font-face {\n      font-family: 'Inter';\n      font-style: normal;\n      font-weight: 400;\n      font-display: block;\n      src: url(https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/inter/v12/UcCO3FwrK3iLTeHuS_fvQtMwCp50KnMw2boKoduKmMEVuLyfAZJhiJ-Ek-_EeAmM.woff2) format('woff2');\n      unicode-range: U+0460-052F, U+1C80-1C88, U+20B4, U+2DE0-2DFF, U+A640-A69F, U+FE2E-FE2F;\n    }\n    /* more font declarations go here */\n    /* latin */\n    @font-face {\n      font-family: 'Inter';\n      font-style: normal;\n      font-weight: 400;\n      font-display: block;\n      src: url(https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/inter/v12/UcCO3FwrK3iLTeHuS_fvQtMwCp50KnMw2boKoduKmMEVuLyfAZ9hiJ-Ek-_EeA.woff2) format('woff2');\n      unicode-range: U+0000-00FF, U+0131, U+0152-0153, U+02BB-02BC, U+02C6, U+02DA, U+02DC, U+0304, U+0308, U+0329, U+2000-206F, U+2074, U+20AC, U+2122, U+2191, U+2193, U+2212, U+2215, U+FEFF, U+FFFD;\n    }`,\n};\nNext.js routing","}`,\n};\nNext.js routing\nNext.js's router is automatically stubbed for you so that when the router is interacted with, all of its interactions are automatically logged to the Actions panel if you have the Storybook actions addon.\nYou should only use next/router in the pages directory.

This follows Node package standards and has benefits when mocking modules.","To configure subpath imports, you define the imports property in your project's package.json file. This property maps the subpath to the actual file path. The example below configures subpath imports for all modules in the project:\n // package.json\n{\n  \"imports\": {\n    \"#*\": [\"./*\", \"./*.ts\", \"./*.tsx\"]\n  }\n}\n‚ÑπÔ∏èBecause subpath imports replace module aliases, you can remove the path aliases from your TypeScript configuration.\nWhich can then be used like this:\n // index.jsx\nimport Button from '#components/button';\nimport styles from '#styles/HomePage.module.css';\n \nexport default function HomePage() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <h1 className={styles.title}>Hello World</h1>\n      <Button />\n    </>\n  );\n}\nMocking modules","<h1 className={styles.title}>Hello World</h1>\n      <Button />\n    </>\n  );\n}\nMocking modules\nComponents often depend on modules that are imported into the component file. These can be from external packages or internal to your project. When rendering those components in Storybook or testing them, you may want to mock those modules to control and assert their behavior.\nBuilt-in mocked modules\nThis framework provides mocks for many of Next.js' internal modules:","@storybook/nextjs/cache.mock\n@storybook/nextjs/headers.mock\n@storybook/nextjs/navigation.mock\n@storybook/nextjs/router.mock\n\nMocking other modules\nHow you mock other modules in Storybook depends on how you import the module into your component.\nWith either approach, the first step is to create a mock file. Here's an example of a mock file for a module named session:\n\n lib/session.mock.tsimport { fn } from '@storybook/test';\nimport * as actual from './session';\n \nexport * from './session';\nexport const getUserFromSession = fn(actual.getUserFromSession).mockName('getUserFromSession');\n\nWith subpath imports\nIf you're using subpath imports, you can adjust your configuration to apply conditions so that the mocked module is used inside Storybook. The example below configures subpath imports for four internal modules, which are then mocked in Storybook:","package.json{\n  \"imports\": {\n    \"#api\": {\n      // storybook condition applies to Storybook\n      \"storybook\": \"./api.mock.ts\",\n      \"default\": \"./api.ts\",\n    },\n    \"#app/actions\": {\n      \"storybook\": \"./app/actions.mock.ts\",\n      \"default\": \"./app/actions.ts\",\n    },\n    \"#lib/session\": {\n      \"storybook\": \"./lib/session.mock.ts\",\n      \"default\": \"./lib/session.ts\",\n    },\n    \"#lib/db\": {\n      // test condition applies to test environments *and* Storybook\n      \"test\": \"./lib/db.mock.ts\",\n      \"default\": \"./lib/db.ts\",\n    },\n    \"#*\": [\"./*\", \"./*.ts\", \"./*.tsx\"],\n  },\n}\n\n‚ÑπÔ∏èEach subpath must begin with #, to differentiate it from a regular module path. The #* entry is a catch-all that maps all subpaths to the root directory.\nWith module aliases\nIf you're using module aliases, you can add a Webpack alias to your Storybook configuration to point to the mock file.","vitewebpack .storybook/main.tsTypescript// Replace your-framework with the framework you are using (e.g., react-webpack5, vue3-vite)\nimport type { StorybookConfig } from '@storybook/your-framework';\n \nconst config: StorybookConfig = {\n  framework: '@storybook/your-framework',\n  stories: ['../src/**/*.mdx', '../src/**/*.stories.@(js|jsx|mjs|ts|tsx)'],\n  viteFinal: async (config) => {\n    if (config.resolve) {\n      config.resolve.alias = {\n        ...config.resolve?.alias,\n        // üëá External module\n        lodash: require.resolve('./lodash.mock'),\n        // üëá Internal modules\n        '@/api': path.resolve(__dirname, './api.mock.ts'),\n        '@/app/actions': path.resolve(__dirname, './app/actions.mock.ts'),\n        '@/lib/session': path.resolve(__dirname, './lib/session.mock.ts'),\n        '@/lib/db': path.resolve(__dirname, './lib/db.mock.ts'),\n      };\n    }\n \n    return config;\n  },\n};\n \nexport default config;","Runtime config\nNext.js allows for Runtime Configuration which lets you import a handy getConfig function to get certain configuration defined in your next.config.js file at runtime.\nIn the context of Storybook with this framework, you can expect Next.js's Runtime Configuration feature to work just fine.\nNote, because Storybook doesn't server render your components, your components will only see what they normally see on the client side (i.e. they won't see serverRuntimeConfig but will see publicRuntimeConfig).\nFor example, consider the following Next.js config:\n // next.config.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  serverRuntimeConfig: {\n    mySecret: 'secret',\n    secondSecret: process.env.SECOND_SECRET, // Pass through env variables\n  },\n  publicRuntimeConfig: {\n    staticFolder: '/static',\n  },\n};\nCalls to getConfig would return the following object when called within Storybook:\n // Runtime config\n{\n  \"serverRuntimeConfig\": {},\n  \"publicRuntimeConfig\": {\n    \"staticFolder\": \"/static\"\n  }\n}","{\n  \"serverRuntimeConfig\": {},\n  \"publicRuntimeConfig\": {\n    \"staticFolder\": \"/static\"\n  }\n}\nCustom Webpack config\n‚ÑπÔ∏èYou can safely skip this section if you are using @storybook/experimental-nextjs-vite instead of @storybook/nextjs.\nThe Vite-based Next.js framework does not support Webpack settings.\nNext.js comes with a lot of things for free out of the box like Sass support, but sometimes you add custom Webpack config modifications to Next.js. This framework takes care of most of the Webpack modifications you would want to add. If Next.js supports a feature out of the box, then that feature will work out of the box in Storybook. If Next.js doesn't support something out of the box, but makes it easy to configure, then this framework will do the same for that thing for Storybook.\nAny Webpack modifications desired for Storybook should be made in .storybook/main.js|ts.","Any Webpack modifications desired for Storybook should be made in .storybook/main.js|ts.\nNote: Not all Webpack modifications are copy/paste-able between next.config.js and .storybook/main.js|ts.

If this is the case for you, please install the package directly.\nFAQ\nStories for pages/components which fetch data\nNext.js pages can fetch data directly within server components in the app directory, which often include module imports that only run in a node environment. This does not (currently) work within Storybook, because if you import from a Next.js page file containing those node module imports in your stories, your Storybook's Webpack will crash because those modules will not run in a browser. To get around this, you can extract the component in your page file into a separate file and import that pure component in your stories. Or, if that's not feasible for some reason, you can polyfill those modules in your Storybook's webpackFinal configuration.\nBefore\n // app/my-page/index.jsx\nasync function getData() {\n  const res = await fetch(...);\n  // ...\n}","// app/my-page/index.jsx\nasync function getData() {\n  const res = await fetch(...);\n  // ...\n}\n \n// Using this component in your stories will break the Storybook build\nexport default async function Page() {\n  const data = await getData();\n \n  return // ...\n}\nAfter\n // app/my-page/index.jsx\n \n// Use this component in your stories\nimport MyPage from './components/MyPage';\n \nasync function getData() {\n  const res = await fetch(...);\n  // ...\n}\n \nexport default async function Page() {\n  const data = await getData();\n \n  return <MyPage {...data} />;\n}\nStatically imported images won't load\nMake sure you are treating image imports the same way you treat them when using next/image in normal development.\nBefore using this framework, image imports would import the raw path to the image (e.g. 'static/media/stories/assets/logo.svg'). Now image imports work the \"Next.js way\", meaning that you now get an object when importing an image. For example:\n // Image import object\n{","// Image import object\n{\n  \"src\": \"static/media/stories/assets/logo.svg\",\n  \"height\": 48,\n  \"width\": 48,\n  \"blurDataURL\": \"static/media/stories/assets/logo.svg\"\n}\nTherefore, if something in Storybook isn't showing the image properly, make sure you expect the object to be returned from an import instead of only the asset path.\nSee local images for more detail on how Next.js treats static image imports.\nModule not found: Error: Can't resolve package name\nYou might get this if you're using Yarn v2 or v3.

Storybook is a fantastic way to demo your components in isolation from where they might be used in the application. That can be really handy when you're working with your designer or your product manager to hone in on the UI of just specific components in your application. All right. Let's start off by building our application.","00:22 We're going to call it Storybook with Next.js. This is really simple, so it'll be really quick. I'll start off with all my defaults. Yes to TypeScript, yes to ESLint, yes to Tailwind, Yes to the source directory, of course. Yes to the app router.\n00:36 And no to changing the import alias. I'll bring that up in VS Code. And in that console, I'm gonna do mpx to run Storybook at the latest version. And I'm gonna run the init command on that to initialize our project with Storybook. Looks like it's doing a good job identifying that this is the next application.\n00:56 Now it's actually going to launch Storybook for us. To be honest, I kind of find that more of a hassle. We're going to skip the tour and I'll just show you around myself. So here is our example button. So this is the idea that you have this kind of panel over on the side where you can navigate around and see the different components that you have and actually go and try them out.","01:16 For example, with our button case we can actually change the label here. So I can say, hello there. And you can kind of see how your component reacts to different prop changes. It's really nice. You can deploy this in isolation and let your designer or your product manager try out the different options before it actually goes in the application.\n01:35 It's fantastic, particularly for design systems. All right, let's go take a look at our project and see how it's actually integrated. So over in the source directory, we have a stories folder that has been added. It's got a bunch of assets. It's got, for example, our button in there.\n01:50 This is our button implementation. And then you've got some stories around it. So that's button.stories.ts. Importantly in the stories, there's the meta block and the meta block defines the metadata for your component. So in this case, we got the title.","02:03 That's where it's actually gonna put it in the nav bar. So it's gonna put it under example and then slash button. You're gonna give it the component, which in this case is the button. Any parameters for the story in general, it's gonna lay out in the center. The tags auto docs means that it's going to automatically generate documentation from the stories, which we'll see below.\n02:22 Then you got the different argument types in this case, our background color, we want a color selector on that. And then any default arguments. Now in the case of our button, we've got a bunch of different stories, and each one of those stories comes with different arguments to show off different aspects of your component. Now let's actually try and bring this button into our app. So what I'm gonna do is I'm going to move out button and button stories into our app.","02:53 And I'm gonna get rid of the stories altogether. Now over in button, I'm going to not use the styles. I'm gonna go and use Tailwind for this. So I'm just gonna create a whole new button. It does take a label which is a string.\n03:06 I'm gonna wrap button around that and I'll just give it some nice Tailwind styling. Okay that should be good. Let's go over and take a look at our button stories. Now we're exporting as the default so I no longer need to bring it in as a named constant. We don't have the background color controlling more or an on click.\n03:30 And I'll get rid of the primary here. In fact, I'll get rid of everything except the primary story. All right, let's give it a go. So to run this, I'm going to use pnpm storybook. Now that's actually been created over here in our package.json.","03:49 When we did the storybook init, it automatically added storybook and build storybook. Storybook is essentially dev mode for storybook and build storybook builds a static storybook that you can then deploy on something like S3. So let's run Storybook. All right, there you go, looks really great. It's up and running and we can even change the label.\n04:13 Fantastic. So there it is, a quick and easy way to get Storybook into your Next.js application. They make it super easy. You should go and check out the documentation. There's a whole lot more that comes with Storybook that you should go and check out.","04:26 It is a fantastic platform. We're going to take a look at it again when it comes to monorepos because there's a whole lot more involved when it comes to bringing it into a monorepo and where exactly you want to share your storybook from, whether it is the applications or a shared design system package or all of the applications in kind of a meta storybook. There's a lot of different ways you can roll it out there.Workshop ContentslessonSetting up Storybook with Next.jsJack HerringtonCodeNOTE: To get Tailwind to work in your Storybook previews you'll need to import your globals.css into preview.ts\n// .storybook/preview.ts\nimport \"../src/app/globals.css\"","Storybook is a great way to demo and test your components in isolation, separate from your main application. This makes it a valuable tool for working with designers and product managers, letting you focus on the UI and functionality of individual components.\nCreating a Next.js Project\nTo get started, let's create a new Next.js project using the create-next-app command:\npnpm dlx create-next-app@latest storybook-with-nextjs --use-pnpm\n\nSelect the options for TypeScript, ESLint, Tailwind CSS, and the app router when prompted.\nNext, we'll install Storybook and set it up in our project:\nnpx storybook@latest init","Storybook will detect that we're using a Next.js project and configure itself accordingly. When installation is complete, Storybook will automatically launch in your browser.\nNavigating Storybook\nStorybook has a sidebar with the components you've added, like the example button. You can navigate through these components, change their props, and see how they behave in different scenarios.\n\nProject Structure\nInside of the src directory, Storybook adds a stories folder with example components like the button. The button component itself is implemented in Button.tsx, and its stories are defined in Button.stories.ts.\nThe Button.stories.ts file has a meta block that specifies metadata for the component, like its title, location in the navigation bar, and the component itself. It also has an argTypes section that defines the available props for the button and how they should appear in the Storybook UI.\n// inside Button.stories.ts","const meta = {\n  title: 'Example/Button',\n  component: Button,\n  parameters: {\n    layout: 'centered',\n  },\n  tags: ['autodocs'],\n  argTypes: {\n    backgroundColor: { control: 'color' },\n  }\n}\n\nAfter the meta block, you'll see individual stories for the button component. Each story shows a different use case or variation of the component with specific props:\nexport const Primary: Story = {\n  args: {\n    primary: true,\n    label: 'Button',\n  },\n};\n\nexport const Secondary: Story = {\n  args: {\n    label: 'Button',\n  },\n};\n\nexport const Large: Story = {\n  args: {\n    size: 'large',\n    label: 'Button',\n  },\n};","export const Large: Story = {\n  args: {\n    size: 'large',\n    label: 'Button',\n  },\n};\n\nIntegrating a Custom Button Component\nLet's bring the button component into our app.\nFirst move the Button.tsx and Button.stories.ts files from the stories directory to the app directory, then remove the stories directory.\nNow, let's add our own button component to Storybook. We'll move the existing Button and Button.stories.tsx files from the stories directory into our app directory.\nOpen the demo Button.tsx file and replace the existing code with this new button that uses Tailwind CSS for styling:\nexport default function Button({ label }: { label: string }) {\n  return (\n    <button className=\"px-5 py-2 bg-blue-800 text-white text-2xl\">\n      {label}\n    </button>\n  );\n}","This code defines a simple button component using Tailwind CSS classes for styling.\nNext, open the Button.stories.tsx file and update it like this:\nimport type { Meta, StoryObj } from '@storybook/react'\nimport Button from './Button'\n\nconst meta = {\n  title: 'Example/Button',\n  component: Button,\n  parameters: {\n    layout: 'centered',\n  },\n  tags: ['autodocs'],\n  argTypes: {\n    backgroundColor: { control: 'color' },\n  }\n} satisfies Meta<typeof Button>\n\nexport default meta\ntype Story = StoryObj<typeof meta>\n\nexport const Primary: Story = {\n  args: {\n    label: 'Button',\n  },\n}\n\nThis code defines the meta information for our button component and includes a single story named \"Primary\" that renders the button with the label \"Button\".\nRunning Storybook\nWith our button component integrated, we can now run Storybook again:\npnpm storybook","There is also a build-storybook script that has been added to the package.json file. This script generates a static version of Storybook that you can deploy own its own.","You should now see our custom button component in the Storybook UI, with the Tailwind CSS styling. You can interact with the component, change its label, and explore its behavior in isolation.\nNext Steps\nThere's a lot more that Storybook can do beyond the example here. Check out the Storybook docs to learn more about its features and how to make the most of it in your projects.\nWe'll be revisiting Storybook later when we look at integrating it into monorepos and shared design systems.Transcript00:00 Let me show you how to set up the awesome Storybook with Next.js.

@chantasticLast updated: Jul 03, 20242023 UPDATE: Storybook created a zero-config integration with NextJS. Learn how to use it here.Next.js is a fantastic framework for building high-performance applications in React. But as it becomes more advanced ‚Äî with features like next/image ‚Äî it becomes more difficult to integrate with documentation and testing environments like Storybook.I dove in deep to learn how to make Storybook the best component-driven UI environment for Next.js pages. This article shows you how to do the same in four straightforward steps:üì¶ Initialize a new Storybook with Webpack 5üìë Create stories for Next.js pagesüåé Import shared, global styles in preview.js‚¨áÔ∏è De-optimize Next Image for use in StoriesIf you prefer video, jump","global styles in preview.js‚¨áÔ∏è De-optimize Next Image for use in StoriesIf you prefer video, jump to the end. We cover all these steps (and more) in a 27 minute code-along YouTube video!Start with a Next.js AppBefore we start, we need a Next.js app. This tutorial uses the fantastic Getting Started guide on nextjs.org.A fresh Next.js app running in the browserI recommend following along in a new app and then repeating the steps in an existing one. Here is the complete source on Github, updated for Next.js 12.Initialize a new Storybook with Webpack 5Storybook has an initializer that does the heavy lifting for us: npx sb init. This script detects your project type and adapts to it. But we can also give it a few hints.Next.js v11 and later use Webpack 5. We can also use Webpack 5 in Storybook to get improved integration and performance. To do that we use the builder option and run this command:npx sb init --builder webpack5Read more about the benefits of Storybook's Webpack 5","this command:npx sb init --builder webpack5Read more about the benefits of Storybook's Webpack 5 builder.Create stories for full Next.js pagesNext.js and Storybook have extremely compatible component models. Next.js uses components for pages and Storybook uses components for documentation and testing. This makes Storybook a great component-driven development environment for Next.js!Let's create a story for our Next.js home page.Create a new file /stories/pages/home.stories.jsxImport /pages/index.jsExport a default story object, with title and component propertiesExport a story for Home// /stories/pages/home.stories.jsx","import Home from \"../../pages/index\";\n\nexport default {\n  title: \"Pages/Home\",\n  component: Home,\n};","export const HomePage = () => <Home />\nWe now have our Home page in Storybook. But it isn't much to look at yet. We need to import global styles.Import shared, global stylesheets in preview.jsMost apps have stylesheet for global resets or font styles that is shared globally. Our Next.js tutorial app holds global styles in /styles/globals.css.We can import our global stylesheet into our home.stories.jsx story file. But doing so would require a lot of duplication in story files ‚Äî a very error-prone process. It'd be better to import global stylesheets one for all stories.Storybook holds shared story configuration in .storybook/preview.js. This file controls the way all stories are rendered. Stylesheets can be imported with a module import:// .storybook/preview.js","import \"../styles/globals.css\";Story, before and after adding globals.css. Much better!We did it! Save for a broken image, our story looks like the homepage served from Next.js.For more ways to handle styles in Storybook, check out our Styling and CSS guide.De-optimize Next.js Image in storiesThe most challenging part of a Next.js and Storybook integration is handling images.Storybook must be configured to serve next/images in the /public directoryNext.js v10 and newer include the Next.js Image component. In their words, it's \"an extension of the HTML <img>element, evolved for the modern web.\" Utilizing it optimizes file size, visual stability, and load times. It's a marvel of UI engineering.Because Storybook runs these components in isolation of Next.js framework-integrations, we need to configure it in two important ways:Serve the Next.js public directory in StorybookAdd the unoptimized prop to Next.js Image component in all stories1. Serve the public directory in StorybookThe sb","prop to Next.js Image component in all stories1. Serve the public directory in StorybookThe sb init script creates two Storybook scripts in our package.json. Update both of them to serve the publicdirectory (where Next.js images are kept). The CLI option we use for this is -s. or --static-dir.// package.json","\"scripts\": {\n-    \"storybook\": \"start-storybook -p 6006\",\n-    \"build-storybook\": \"build-storybook\"\n+    \"storybook\": \"start-storybook -p 6006 -s ./public\",\n+    \"build-storybook\": \"build-storybook -s public\"\n}\nFind more CLI options in our CLI options doc. And learn more about Serving Static Files via Storybook.2. Use the unoptimized prop for Next.js Images in StorybookEverywhere that the Next.js Image component is used, images are served from a /_next-prefixed path. We want to utilize Next Image's prop APIs and attributes, but we don't want to require that the Next.js dev server be running. We can do exactly this with the unoptimized prop. But how do we do this in Storybook but not Next.js ü§îWith a bit of module trickery, we can de-optimize Next.js Image only in stories.// .storybook/preview.js\nimport * as NextImage from \"next/image\";\n\nconst OriginalNextImage = NextImage.default;","Object.defineProperty(NextImage, \"default\", {\n  configurable: true,\n  value: (props) => <OriginalNextImage {...props} unoptimized />,\n});","This snippet of configuration modifies how Storybook evaluates the next/image module. Anywhere that Next.js Image's default export is used, the unoptimized prop is applied.Restart your server and check out the Vercel SVG at the bottom.

Its documentation is user-friendly to help you quickly learn how to use the components and take advantage of their various features.Commonly used Chakra ComponentsBefore we start building the landing page, there are some commonly used Chakra UI components you need to know.Box - This is the same as the HTML div element. It accepts props such as background color, size, width, padding, margin, etc. Flex - This is the same as a div element with its display set to flex. It accepts all the CSS flex attributes as props. Spacer - It is a child element of the Flex component. It determines how spaced the flex items should be. Icon - This allows us to add icons to our web applications. It accepts the icon as a prop and attributes such as box size, color, height, width, etc. Heading - This is the same as the HTML h-tags. ¬†Text - This is the same as the HTML","width, etc. Heading - This is the same as the HTML h-tags. ¬†Text - This is the same as the HTML paragraph tag.Button - This is the same as the HTML button tag.Setting up Chakra in NextJSTo install Chakra UI in a Next.js project, follow the steps below:Create the Next.js project by running the code below.$ npx create-next-app@12 chakra-ui-projectRun the code below to install Chakra UI and its dependencies. $ yarn add @chakra-ui/react @emotion/react @emotion/styled framer-motionWrap the entire app with the ChakraProvider component to enable us to use the Chakra UI components.import \"../styles/globals.css\";","import { ChakraProvider } from \"@chakra-ui/react\";","function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {\n   return (\n       <ChakraProvider>\n           <Component {...pageProps} />\n       </ChakraProvider>\n   );\n} \n\nexport default MyApp;Since there are icons on the web page, install the Chakra UI icon and the React Icons libraries.$ yarn add @chakra-ui/icons react-iconsHow to use fonts in ChakraHere, you'll learn how to use Google fonts in a Chakra UI project. Visit the Google font webpage for Montserrat, the one used in this project. Add all the font variants and copy the link for the font.Next, create a pages/_document.js file and copy the code below into the file. The _document.js file can update the HTML and BODY tags of a Next.js web page.import { Html, Head, Main, NextScript } from \"next/document\";","export default function Document() {\n   return (\n       <Html>\n           <Head>\n               <link rel='preconnect' href='https://fonts.googleapis.com' />\n               <link\n                   rel='preconnect'\n                   href='https://fonts.gstatic.com'\n                   crossOrigin='true'\n               />\n               <link\n                   href='https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Montserrat:wght@100;200;300;400;500;600;700;800;900&display=swap'\n                   rel='stylesheet'\n               />\n           </Head>\n           <body>\n               <Main />\n               <NextScript />\n           </body>\n       </Html>\n   );\n}Update the _app.js to add the Montserrat font to Chakra UI.import \"../styles/globals.css\";\nimport { ChakraProvider } from \"@chakra-ui/react\";\nimport { extendTheme } from \"@chakra-ui/react\";\n\n\nconst theme = extendTheme({\n   fonts: {\n       heading: `'Montserrat', sans-serif`,\n       body: `'Montserrat', sans-serif`,\n   },\n});","function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {\n   return (\n       <ChakraProvider theme={theme}>\n           <Component {...pageProps} />\n       </ChakraProvider>\n   );\n}","export default MyApp;The extendTheme function allows us to edit and extend the default UI styles provided by Chakra UI.Finally, copy the CSS code here into the styles/globals.css file.

Key updates include:\n\nReact 19 (stable): Support for React 19 is officially available in both Pages Router & App Router.\nImproved Error Debugging: Enhanced DX and better source maps for the browser and the terminal.\nafter (stable): New API to execute code after a response has finished streaming.\nforbidden / unauthorized (experimental): New APIs to enable more granular authentication error handling.","Upgrade today, or get started with:\nTerminal# Use the automated upgrade CLI\nnpx @next/codemod@canary upgrade latest\n \n# ...or upgrade manually\nnpm install next@latest react@latest react-dom@latest\n \n# ...or start a new project\nnpx create-next-app@latest\nReact 19 (stable)\n\n\n\n\n\nNext.js 15.1 now fully supports React 19:\n\nFor the Pages Router: you can now use React 19 stable without needing the Release Candidate or Canary releases, alongside continued support for React 18.\nFor the App Router: we will continue to provide React Canary releases built-in. These include all the stable React 19 changes, as well as newer features being validated in frameworks, prior to a new React release.\n\nSince the Next.js 15 release, a significant addition to React 19 was ‚Äúsibling pre-warming‚Äù.\nFor a comprehensive overview of React 19‚Äôs updates, please refer to the official React 19 blog post.\nImproved Error Debugging","We‚Äôve made improvements to error debugging in Next.js, ensuring you can quickly locate the source of issues, whether they appear in the terminal, browser, or attached debuggers. These enhancements apply to both Webpack and Turbopack (now stable with Next.js 15).\nSource Maps Enhancements\n\n\n\n\n\nErrors are now easier to trace back to their origin through the improved use of source maps. We‚Äôve implemented the ignoreList property of source maps, which allows Next.js to hide stack frames for external dependencies, making your application code the primary focus.\nFor slightly more accurate source mapping of method names, we suggest adopting Turbopack (now stable), which has improved handling and detection of source maps over Webpack.\n\nFor library authors: We recommend populating the ignoreList property in sourcemaps when publishing your libraries, especially if they are configured as external (e.g. in the serverExternalPackages config).\n\nCollapsed Stack Frames","Collapsed Stack Frames\n\n\n\n\n\nWe‚Äôve improved the logic for collapsing stack frames to highlight the most relevant parts of your code.\n\nIn the browser and error overlay: Stack frames from third-party dependencies are hidden by default, focusing on your application code. You can reveal the hidden frames by clicking ‚ÄúShow ignored frames‚Äù in the devtools or the overlay.\nIn the terminal: Third-party dependency frames are also collapsed by default, and error formatting now aligns with the browser output for a consistent debugging experience. Errors are replayed in the browser to ensure you don‚Äôt miss important information during development if you need the entire stack trace.\n\nEnhanced Profiling\n\n\n\n\n\nIgnored stack frames are also recognized by built-in browser profilers. This makes profiling your application easier, allowing you to pinpoint slow functions in your code without noise from external libraries.\nImproved with the Edge Runtime","When using the Edge runtime, errors are now displayed consistently across development environments, ensuring seamless debugging. Previously, logged errors would only include the message and not the stack.\nBefore and after","Terminal Before:\nTerminal ‚®Ø app/page.tsx (6:11) @ eval\n ‚®Ø Error: boom\n    at eval (./app/page.tsx:12:15)\n    at Page (./app/page.tsx:11:74)\n    at AsyncLocalStorage.run (node:async_hooks:346:14)\n    at stringify (<anonymous>)\n    at AsyncLocalStorage.run (node:async_hooks:346:14)\n    at AsyncResource.runInAsyncScope (node:async_hooks:206:9)\ndigest: \"380744807\"\n  4 | export default function Page() {\n  5 |   const throwError = myCallback(() => {\n> 6 |     throw new Error('boom')\n    |           ^\n  7 |   }, [])\n  8 |\n  9 |   throwError()\n GET / 500 in 2354ms\nTerminal After:\nTerminal  ‚®Ø Error: boom\n    at eval (app/page.tsx:6:10)\n    at Page (app/page.tsx:5:32)\n  4 | export default function Page() {\n  5 |   const throwError = myCallback(() => {\n> 6 |     throw new Error('boom')\n    |          ^\n  7 |   }, [])\n  8 |\n  9 |   throwError() {\n  digest: '225828171'\n}\nError Overlay Before\nAn example of the Next.js error overlay before version 15.1\nError Overlay After","An example of the Next.js error overlay before version 15.1\nError Overlay After\nAn example of the Next.js error overlay after version 15.1\nThese improvements make errors clearer and more intuitive, allowing you to focus your time building your application rather than debugging.\nWe‚Äôre also thrilled to announce the introduction of a redesigned UI for the error overlay, coming in upcoming releases.\nafter (stable)","The after() API is now stable following its introduction in the first Next.js 15 RC.\nafter() provides a way to perform tasks such as logging, analytics, and other system synchronization after the response has finished streaming to the user, without blocking the primary response.\nKey changes\n\n\n\n\n\nSince its introduction, we‚Äôve stabilized after() and addressed feedback including:\n\nImproved support for self-hosted Next.js servers.\nBug fixes for scenarios where after() interacted with other Next.js features.\nEnhanced extensibility, enabling other platforms to inject their own waitUntil() primitives to power after().\nSupport for runtime APIs such as cookies() and headers() in Server Actions and Route Handlers.","app/layout.jsimport { after } from 'next/server';\nimport { log } from '@/app/utils';\n \nexport default function Layout({ children }) {\n  // Secondary task\n  after(() => {\n    log();\n  });\n \n  // Primary task\n  return <>{children}</>;\n}\nRead more about the after API and how to leverage it in the documentation.\nforbidden and unauthorized (experimental)\n\n\n\n\n\nNext.js 15.1 includes two experimental APIs, forbidden() and unauthorized(), based on community feedback.\n\nWe‚Äôd love your feedback ‚Äî please try it in your development environments and share your thoughts in this discussion thread.\n\nOverview\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you‚Äôre familiar with the App Router, you‚Äôve likely used notFound() to trigger 404 behavior alongside the customizable not-found.tsx file. With version 15.1, we‚Äôre extending this approach to authorization errors:\n‚Ä¢ forbidden() triggers a 403 error with customizable UI via forbidden.tsx.\n‚Ä¢ unauthorized() triggers a 401 error with customizable UI via unauthorized.tsx.","Good to know: As with notFound() errors, the status code will be 200 if the error is triggered after initial response headers have been sent. Learn more.\n\nEnabling the feature\n\n\n\n\n\nAs this feature is still experimental, you‚Äôll need to enable it in your next.config.ts file:\nnext.config.tsimport type { NextConfig } from 'next';\n \nconst nextConfig: NextConfig = {\n  experimental: {\n    authInterrupts: true,\n  },\n};\n \nexport default nextConfig;\n\nNote: next.config.ts support was introduced in Next.js 15. Learn more.\n\nUsing forbidden() and unauthorized()","Using forbidden() and unauthorized()\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can use forbidden() and unauthorized() in Server Actions, Server Components, Client Components, or Route Handlers. Here‚Äôs an example:\nimport { verifySession } from '@/app/lib/dal';\nimport { forbidden } from 'next/navigation';\n \nexport default async function AdminPage() {\n  const session = await verifySession();\n \n  // Check if the user has the 'admin' role\n  if (session.role !== 'admin') {\n    forbidden();\n  }\n \n  // Render the admin page for authorized users\n  return <h1>Admin Page</h1>;\n}\nCreating custom error pages","To customize the error pages, create the following files:\napp/forbidden.tsximport Link from 'next/link';\n \nexport default function Forbidden() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h2>Forbidden</h2>\n      <p>You are not authorized to access this resource.</p>\n      <Link href=\"/\">Return Home</Link>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\napp/unauthorized.tsximport Link from 'next/link';\n \nexport default function Unauthorized() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h2>Unauthorized</h2>\n      <p>Please log in to access this page.</p>\n      <Link href=\"/login\">Go to Login</Link>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\nWe'd like to thank Clerk for proposing this feature through a PR and assisting us in prototyping the API. Before we stabilize this feature in 15.2, we're planning on adding more capabilities and improvements to the APIs to support a wider range of use cases.\nRead the documentation for the unauthorized and forbidden APIs for more details.\nOther Changes","[Feature] Use ESLint 9 in create-next-app (PR)\n[Feature] Increase max cache tags to 128 (PR)\n[Feature] Add an option to disable experimental CssChunkingPlugin (PR)\n[Feature] Add experimental CSS inlining support (PR)\n[Improvement] Silence Sass legacy-js-api warning (PR)\n[Improvement] Fix unhandled rejection when using rewrites (PR)\n[Improvement] Ensure parent process exits when webpack worker fails (PR)\n[Improvement] Fixed route interception on a catch-all route (PR)\n[Improvement] Fixed response cloning issue in request deduping (PR)\n[Improvement] Fixed Server Action redirects between multiple root layouts (PR)\n[Improvement] Support providing MDX plugins as strings for Turbopack compatibility (PR)\n\nContributors\n\n\n\n\n\nNext.js is the result of the combined work of over 3,000 individual developers.

of the React ecosystem. This update also includes several noteworthy improvements:\n\n\n\n  üåü 1. Compatibility with React 19\n\nReact 19 is one of the most significant updates to the library in recent years, introducing features like performance improvements, modernized APIs, and changes to rendering behavior.\nNext.js 15.1 has quickly adopted these changes, enabling developers to seamlessly leverage React 19‚Äôs latest features in their projects. This compatibility ensures a smooth experience for those migrating to React 19.\n\n\n\n\n  üõ†Ô∏è 2. Improved Debugging Tools","üõ†Ô∏è 2. Improved Debugging Tools\n\nDebugging complex applications is always a challenge. In this release, Next.js has enhanced its debugging tools to make error messages clearer and more precise.\nKey improvements include: \n\nMore detailed error messages.\n\nHighlighting exact locations in the code where issues occur.\n\nClear explanations of why certain errors happen.\n\n\nThese improvements make it easier for developers to identify and resolve problems, boosting productivity.  \n\n\n\n\n  ‚úÖ 3. The after() Method is Now Stable\n\nThe after() method allows developers to define tasks that should be executed after a specific event, such as completing an HTTP request or finishing a function.\nNow fully stable, it‚Äôs particularly useful for:  \n\nLogging actions.\n\nCleaning up resources after operations.\n\n\nThis feature provides a clean and structured way to handle post-event logic.  \n\n\n\n\n  ‚ö° 4.

Introduction\nBrief Explanation\nAutomating everyday tasks with Python scripts is a powerful way to streamline workflows, reduce manual effort, and increase productivity. Python, with its simplicity, flexibility, and extensive libraries, is an ideal choice for automating tasks such as file management, data processing, system administration, and even interacting with web services.\nImportance\nAutomation eliminates repetitive tasks, reduces the potential for human error, and allows you to focus on more critical and creative work. By leveraging Python scripts, you can create custom solutions tailored to your specific needs, whether personal or professional.\nWhat Readers Will Learn\nBy the end of this tutorial, readers will learn how to:\n‚Äì Create Python scripts to automate common tasks\n‚Äì Use Python libraries for file operations, system interactions, and data manipulation\n‚Äì Handle errors and edge cases","‚Äì Handle errors and edge cases\n‚Äì Implement best practices for writing efficient and maintainable code\nPrerequisites","Basic understanding of Python programming concepts (variables, loops, functions)\nPython installed on your system (preferably Python 3.8 or later)\nFamiliarity with the command line or terminal\n\nTechnologies/Tools Needed\n\nPython 3.8+\nPython Standard Library (shutil, os, datetime, etc.)\nThird-party libraries (requests, openpyxl, schedule)\nText editor or IDE (Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, etc.)\n\nRelevant Links\n\nPython Official Website\nRequests Library\nOpenPyXL\nSchedule Library\n\n2. Technical Background\nCore Concepts and Terminology\n\nScripting: Writing programs that automate sequences of tasks.\nModules/Libraries: Pre-written code that provides specific functionalities (e.g., file handling, network requests).\nFile Operations: Reading, writing, copying, moving, and deleting files.\nSystem Operations: Interacting with the operating system (e.g., running shell commands, checking system status).\nError Handling: Managing unexpected events or errors gracefully.","How It Works Under the Hood\nPython scripts execute bytecode that interacts with the operating system and other programs through libraries. These libraries abstract low-level operations, making it easier to perform tasks such as file manipulation, network requests, and more.\nBest Practices\n\nModular Code: Break down scripts into reusable functions and modules.\nError Handling: Use try-except blocks to handle potential errors.\nLogging: Keep track of script execution for debugging and auditing.\nTesting: Validate scripts with test cases before deploying them in production environments.\n\nCommon Pitfalls\n\nPermission Issues: Ensure scripts have the necessary permissions to access files and resources.\nPath Handling: Be cautious with absolute vs. relative paths.\nDependencies: Manage third-party libraries to avoid version conflicts.\n\n3.

Best Practices and Optimization\nPerformance Considerations\nUse multithreading or multiprocessing for tasks that involve waiting, such as network requests.\n\nimport concurrent.futures\n\ndef fetch_url(url):\n    import requests\n    response = requests.get(url)\n    return response.status_code","def main():\n    urls = [\"http://example.com/page1\", \"http://example.com/page2\", \"http://example.com/page3\"]\n    with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:\n        futures = {executor.submit(fetch_url, url): url for url in urls}\n        for future in concurrent.futures.as_completed(futures):\n            url = futures[future]\n            try:\n                status_code = future.result()\n                print(f\"URL: {url}, Status: {status_code}\")\n            except Exception as e:\n                print(f\"Error fetching {url}: {e}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nSecurity Considerations\n\nAvoid hard-coding sensitive information. Use environment variables or secure configuration files.\n\n\nimport os\n\n# Instead of:\n# api_key = \"your-secret-api-key\"\n\n# Use:\napi_key = os.getenv(\"API_KEY\")\nif not api_key:\n    raise ValueError(\"API_KEY environment variable not set\")\n\nCode Organization Tips\nOrganize your code into a clear directory structure:","Code Organization Tips\nOrganize your code into a clear directory structure:\n\nproject/\n‚îÇ\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/\n‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.py\n‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ utils/\n‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ file_utils.py\n‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ email_utils.py\n‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ data/\n‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ data.xlsx\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ configs/\n‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ config.json\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ logs/\n‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ app.log\n‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt\n\n6.

If you‚Äôre anything like me, you probably find the repetitive tasks of setting up new Python projects a bit‚Ä¶ well, boring. You know the drill: create directories, set up virtual environments, install dependencies, initialize Git ‚Äî it‚Äôs all pretty standard, but it takes time. So, I decided to automate the whole process to free up more time for actual coding. And trust me, it‚Äôs a game changer.This post isn‚Äôt a one-size-fits-all solution or some grand tutorial. It‚Äôs just me sharing how I automated my Python project setup with a couple of batch scripts, create_project.bat and setup_git.bat, and how it made my life a whole lot easier. My hope is that it inspires you to automate your own workflows","it made my life a whole lot easier. My hope is that it inspires you to automate your own workflows and save yourself from the grunt work too!My Time-Saving SidekickI built the create_project.bat script to handle all the tedious stuff: setting up folders, creating virtual environments, installing the right libraries, and even initializing Git. It‚Äôs like having a personal assistant for project setup.What It Does for Me:Project Types: I usually switch between basic Python projects and AI projects, so I added an option to support both.Optional Streamlit Integration: Sometimes I need to build quick web apps, and Streamlit‚Äôs my go-to, so I added an option to install it during setup.Virtual Environment: No more manual activation ‚Äî this script takes care of that.Automatic Dependency Installation: Based on the project type, it installs the essential libraries like numpy or tensorflow.Git Setup: It even calls another script to initialize my Git repository and push to GitHub. Easy!The Script in","It even calls another script to initialize my Git repository and push to GitHub. Easy!The Script in Action:Choosing My Project Typeif \"%1\"==\"\" (  echo Usage: %0 [base|ai] project_name  exit /b 1)I love that I can quickly switch between a base or AI project by just typing a command.2. Creating the Structuremkdir %PROJECT_NAME%cd %PROJECT_NAME%mkdir src testsIt whips up the folder structure for me, saving time and ensuring consistency.3. README and .gitignoreecho # %PROJECT_NAME% > README.mdecho myenv/ > .gitignoreA README with instructions and a .gitignore file, all without lifting a finger.4. Virtual Environment Setuppython -m venv myenvcall myenv\\Scripts\\activateIt creates and activates the virtual environment right then and there ‚Äî one less thing for me to worry about.5. Handling Dependenciesif \"%PROJECT_TYPE%\"==\"ai\" (  echo tensorflow > ai_requirements.txt) else (  echo numpy > base_requirements.txt)pip install -r %REQUIREMENTS_FILE%Based on whether I‚Äôm working on AI or a regular","install -r %REQUIREMENTS_FILE%Based on whether I‚Äôm working on AI or a regular project, the right libraries are installed.6. Optional Streamlit Setupif /I \"%STREAMLIT_REQ%\"==\"y\" (  pip install streamlit)Sometimes I need Streamlit for building web apps, and I love that I can just type ‚Äúy‚Äù to get it installed.7. Git Setupcall setup_git.bat %PROJECT_NAME%The script calls another script to initialize my Git repo and push everything to GitHub. It‚Äôs a beautiful thing.How I Handle GitI also got tired of manually setting up Git every time, so I built the setup_git.bat script to automate that part too. It asks for my GitHub repo URL, initializes the Git repository, commits everything, and pushes it.Why It‚Äôs a Lifesaver:Git Initialization: No need to type git init anymore.Connect to GitHub: Just give it the GitHub URL and the script handles the rest.First Commit and Push: It stages and pushes everything to my repo with a single command.The Nitty-GrittyRepo URL Promptset /p GITHUB_URL=\"Enter your","to my repo with a single command.The Nitty-GrittyRepo URL Promptset /p GITHUB_URL=\"Enter your GitHub repository URL: \"I just enter the GitHub repo URL, and the script does its thing.2. Git Init and Commitgit initgit add .git commit -m \"Initial commit\"No more forgetting to commit files or manually adding them.3. Push to GitHubgit remote add origin %GITHUB_URL_FULL%git push -u origin masterAnd just like that, my project is live on GitHub.Why I‚Äôm Loving This ApproachIt‚Äôs simple. Automating these tasks saves me tons of time. I don‚Äôt have to think about all the little things like creating folders, setting up environments, or connecting to GitHub. It‚Äôs all done in one go, and it feels like I‚Äôve got a head start on every project. Plus, there‚Äôs something satisfying about watching everything come together in a few seconds.What‚Äôs Next?For me, automation is an ongoing process. While these scripts cover a lot, there‚Äôs always more to streamline. Here are some things I‚Äôm thinking about adding","cover a lot, there‚Äôs always more to streamline. Here are some things I‚Äôm thinking about adding next:More Project Types: I want to expand the script to handle Django, Flask, and even data science projects.Interactive Prompts: I‚Äôm toying with the idea of a more interactive setup where I can pick and choose features as I go.Testing Setup: Maybe I‚Äôll automate setting up pytest or unittest as well.CI/CD Integration: Integrating with GitHub Actions or other CI/CD tools could make deployments smoother.Wrapping UpThis approach to automating my Python project setup has been a total game changer. It‚Äôs not about having a universal solution ‚Äî it‚Äôs about finding what works for me and making my life easier. If you‚Äôre finding your own workflows bogged down with repetitive tasks, maybe this can inspire you to start automating too.Remember, automation isn‚Äôt about perfection; it‚Äôs about freeing up time for the stuff that really matters ‚Äî like writing awesome code. I hope this little glimpse into my","for the stuff that really matters ‚Äî like writing awesome code.

v2.10 with React, there could be several potential causes. Let‚Äôs troubleshoot the issue step-by-step.\nCommon Issues and Troubleshooting Steps\n1. Incorrect Version Installation\nEnsure that you‚Äôre explicitly installing Chakra UI v2.10 and the correct versions of its dependencies. If you‚Äôre using npm or yarn, double-check that you‚Äôre specifying @chakra-ui/[email¬†protected].\n\nFor npm:\n\nbash\nCopy code\nnpm install @chakra-ui/[email¬†protected] @emotion/react @emotion/styled framer-motion\n\n\nFor yarn:\n\nbash\nCopy code\nyarn add @chakra-ui/[email¬†protected] @emotion/react @emotion/styled framer-motion\n\n2. Compatibility Issues with React or Other Dependencies\nChakra UI v2.10 might have compatibility issues with specific versions of React or other dependencies in your project. Check the following:","Chakra UI 2.x requires React 17 or later.\nEnsure that your other dependencies, especially Emotion and Framer Motion, are compatible with Chakra UI v2.10.\n\nTo check your versions:\n\nCheck your package.json for React and Chakra UI version numbers.\nRun the following commands to check the installed versions:\n\nbash\nCopy code\nnpm list react\nnpm list @chakra-ui/react\n\nor if you‚Äôre using yarn:\nbash\nCopy code\nyarn list react\nyarn list @chakra-ui/react\n\nIf React is older than v17, you might need to upgrade it:\nbash\nCopy code\nnpm install react@latest react-dom@latest\n\n3. Peer Dependency Warnings\nWhen you install Chakra UI, you might see peer dependency warnings for @emotion/react, @emotion/styled, or framer-motion. Make sure to install the versions of these libraries that are compatible with Chakra UI v2.10.\n\nChakra UI v2.10 requires @emotion/react, @emotion/styled, and framer-motion. You can install specific versions by running the following:","bash\nCopy code\nnpm install @emotion/react@latest @emotion/styled@latest framer-motion@latest\n\n4. Clear Cache and Reinstall Dependencies\nSometimes, issues may arise from cached files or partial installs. Try clearing your npm/yarn cache and reinstalling the dependencies.\nFor npm:\nbash\nCopy code\nnpm cache clean --force\nrm -rf node_modules\nrm package-lock.json\nnpm install\n\nFor yarn:\nbash\nCopy code\nyarn cache clean\nrm -rf node_modules\nrm yarn.lock\nyarn install\n\n5. Check for Errors in the Console\nAfter running npm install or yarn install, check the terminal for any errors or warnings. These can often provide clues about what‚Äôs going wrong.\nIf you see any specific error messages, feel free to share them with me, and I can help you resolve them.\n6. Ensure Proper Imports in Your Files\nMake sure you‚Äôre importing Chakra UI components correctly in your files. Chakra UI components are imported from @chakra-ui/react. For example:\njsx\nCopy code\nimport { Button, Box, Text } from '@chakra-ui/react';","7. Issues Related to ChakraProvider Setup\nAfter installing Chakra UI, you must wrap your application in the ChakraProvider component to apply Chakra‚Äôs global styles.\nEnsure that you have set up your index.js or main.js file correctly:\njsx\nCopy code\nimport React from 'react';\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom';\nimport { ChakraProvider } from '@chakra-ui/react';\nimport App from './App';\nimport './index.css';\n\nReactDOM.render(\n  <React.StrictMode>\n    <ChakraProvider>\n      <App />\n    </ChakraProvider>\n  </React.StrictMode>,\n  document.getElementById('root')\n);","If you forget to wrap your app in the ChakraProvider, Chakra UI components will not be styled as expected.\n8. React Strict Mode Issues\nIn rare cases, issues with React Strict Mode can cause unexpected behaviors with certain libraries. If you‚Äôre running into errors, try disabling Strict Mode temporarily in your index.js:\njsx\nCopy code\nReactDOM.render(\n  <ChakraProvider>\n    <App />\n  </ChakraProvider>,\n  document.getElementById('root')\n);\n\nIf this fixes the issue, you may need to identify the specific package or feature causing the issue when running React in Strict Mode.\n\n\n\n\n2 Likes\n\n\n\n\n\nYannick\n\n\n\n                    November 19, 2024,  6:09pm\n                  \n\n3\n\n\n\nThank You, let me give it a try and see.\nYou created the vite using vite @4.1.0, same as the coding lesson or the latest version of vite ?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYannick\n\n\n\n                    November 19, 2024,  6:32pm\n                  \n\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Oussama170:","November 19, 2024,  6:32pm\n                  \n\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Oussama170:\n\nnpm install @chakra-ui/[email¬†protected] @emotion/react @emotion/styled framer-motion\n\n\nIt worked from the first step, it was the version of Chakra that was making it hard.\nThank you for the help\n\n\n\n\n1 Like\n\n\n\n\n\n    Related topics\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nTopic\n\nReplies\nViews\nActivity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstalling Chakra UI\n\n\n\n\n\nReact\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n330\n\n\n              October 28, 2024\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nReact Typescript Project...

to Next.js, a React framework that‚Äôs gaining widespread popularity among web developers. Next.js simplifies the process of building React applications by providing a robust set of features like server-side rendering, and static site generation.This makes it an excellent choice for creating fast, scalable, and SEO-friendly web applications!In this tutorial, we‚Äôre going to harness the power of Next.js to build a static landing page. Our goal is to create a simple landing page with a navigation menu and a few different pages.This tutorial is designed for beginners, but even if you‚Äôre an experienced developer, you might find some useful refreshers along the way.Setup and Project StructurePhoto by Mohammad Rahmani on UnsplashFirst things first,","along the way.Setup and Project StructurePhoto by Mohammad Rahmani on UnsplashFirst things first, let‚Äôs set up a new Next.js project. If you‚Äôre new to Next.js, don‚Äôt worry ‚Äî the setup process is straightforward. Here‚Äôs how you do it:Part 1: Basic SetupInstall Node.js: Before we begin, ensure you have Node.js installed on your system. This is essential as Next.js runs on Node.js. You can download and install it from the official Node.js website.Create a Next.js App: Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:npx create-next-app my-landing-pageFeel free to replace ‚Äòmy-landing-page‚Äô with whatever name you wish to give your project. This command creates a new folder named after your project and installs all of the necessary dependencies for the initial application.This tutorial uses JavaScript , but feel free to follow along in typescript!Part 2: Look Around!Explore the File Structure: After the installation process is complete, navigate to your project folder and","the File Structure: After the installation process is complete, navigate to your project folder and open it in your favorite code editor. You‚Äôll notice several directories and files:app: Replaces the traditional pages directory in Next.js 13, offering a more organized way to structure pages and components.public: This directory is for static files like images, fonts, or any other files that need to be served unchanged.styles: Here, you can add your CSS files. Next.js supports various styling options.By default, Next.js comes with some pre-configured files and folders. This setup helps in getting projects off the ground quickly.Part 3: Creating The Project StructureNow that we have our Next.js app set up, let‚Äôs structure it for our static landing page.Creating Basic Pages:Our project currently has a default index.js page in the pages directory. This will serve as our Home page.For additional pages like About and Contact, create directories and files within app (e.g., app/about/page.js","pages like About and Contact, create directories and files within app (e.g., app/about/page.js and app/contact/page.js).In about.js and contact.js, add a basic functional component. For example, in about.js, you can start with something like this:export default function About() {  return <div>About us</div>;}Do the same for contact.js, replacing About with Contact. This will give us a basic structure to work with.Understanding the Page System:Each page.js file under the app directory represents a route. For example, app/about/page.js becomes accessible at /about.This system simplifies routing, removing the need for manual route configuration.At this point, you have a Next.js application with a basic structure. You can run npm run dev in your terminal, and your app will be up and running at http://localhost:3000. You'll be able to navigate to /about and /contact, seeing the respective text rendered on the page.In the next section, we‚Äôll dive into creating a consistent layout for our","text rendered on the page.In the next section, we‚Äôll dive into creating a consistent layout for our application, including a navigation menu and footer, and then implement basic routing to link our pages together.Designing the LayoutPhoto by Hal Gatewood on UnsplashA well-structured layout is crucial for any website. It ensures a consistent look and feel across different pages. In Next.js, we achieve this by creating a Layout component. Let's build one!Setting Up the Layout Component:In your project directory, create a new folder named components.Inside the components folder, create a file named Layout.js.Now, let‚Äôs write the Layout component. Add the following code to Layout.js:export default function Layout({ children }) {  return (    <div>      <header>        {/* Navigation links will go here */}      </header>      <main>{children}</main>      <footer>        {/* Footer content */}      </footer>    </div>  );}This component takes children as a prop and renders them between the","</footer>    </div>  );}This component takes children as a prop and renders them between the header and footer.Implementing the Layout in Pages:With our Layout component ready, let's incorporate it into our pages.Using Layout in Index PageOpen pages/index.js.Import the Layout component at the top of the file:import Layout from '../components/Layout';Wrap the existing content of index.js inside the Layout component:export default function Home() {  return (    <Layout>      <h1>Welcome to Our Landing Page</h1>      {/* More content can be added here */}    </Layout>  );}This will render the homepage content within the common layout, ensuring consistency across the site.Repeating for Other PagesFollow the same steps for about.js and contact.js. Import and wrap the content in the Layout component.This ensures that all your pages have a consistent header and footer.Basic RoutingPhoto by Firmbee.com on UnsplashNext.js simplifies routing with its file-system-based router. Let‚Äôs set up","Firmbee.com on UnsplashNext.js simplifies routing with its file-system-based router. Let‚Äôs set up navigation for our site.Adding Navigation LinksIn your Layout.js, let's add some navigation links. First, import Link from next/link at the top of the file.Update the header section with navigation links:import Link from 'next/link';// Inside your Layout component<header>  <nav>    <Link href=\"/\"><a>Home</a></Link>    <Link href=\"/about\"><a>About</a></Link>    <Link href=\"/contact\"><a>Contact</a></Link>  </nav></header>These Link components enable client-side navigation between your pages without a full page reload, making the experience faster and smoother.Understanding Next.js Navigation:The Link component from Next.js pre-fetches the linked pages, resulting in a near-instantaneous navigation experience.Unlike traditional anchor tags (<a>), Link doesn't cause a browser refresh.Wrapping Up the Layout and RoutingAt this point, we have a functional layout with a navigation header and a","Up the Layout and RoutingAt this point, we have a functional layout with a navigation header and a footer, used consistently across our pages. We‚Äôve also implemented basic routing, enabling easy navigation through the site. This setup forms the backbone of most Next.js applications, providing a scalable and maintainable structure.Next, we‚Äôll explore adding dynamic elements and interactivity to our landing page, further enhancing its functionality and user experience.Adding Dynamic Elements and InteractivityPhoto by Jotform on UnsplashA static landing page can be more engaging with dynamic content and interactive elements. Let‚Äôs explore how to add these features in Next.js.Creating a Contact Form ComponentIn the components folder, create a new file named ContactForm.js.Add a simple contact form structure with name, email, and message fields:export default function ContactForm() {  return (    <form>      <input type=\"text\" placeholder=\"Your Name\" />      <input type=\"email\"","{  return (    <form>      <input type=\"text\" placeholder=\"Your Name\" />      <input type=\"email\" placeholder=\"Your Email\" />      <textarea placeholder=\"Your Message\"></textarea>      <button type=\"submit\">Send</button>    </form>  );}This form doesn‚Äôt need to be functional yet; we‚Äôre focusing on structure and layout.Adding the Form to the Contact PageImport ContactForm into contact.js and include it in the page layout:import Layout from '../components/Layout';import ContactForm from '../components/ContactForm';export default function Contact() {  return (    <Layout>      <h1>Contact Us</h1>      <ContactForm />    </Layout>  );}Implementing a Simple JavaScript Interaction:Let‚Äôs add a basic JavaScript interaction to our homepage. For example, a button that toggles additional content.In index.js, add a button and some state to manage its visibility:import { useState } from 'react';import Layout from '../components/Layout';export default function Home() {  const [showMore,","Layout from '../components/Layout';export default function Home() {  const [showMore, setShowMore] = useState(false);  return (    <Layout>      <h1>Welcome to Our Landing Page</h1>      <button onClick={() => setShowMore(!showMore)}>        {showMore ? 'Show Less' : 'Show More'}      </button>      {showMore && <p>Here is some more content!</p>}    </Layout>  );}ConclusionPhoto by Rahul Mishra on UnsplashCongratulations! You‚Äôve now built a basic static landing page with Next.js, complete with a consistent layout, basic routing, and some dynamic, interactive elements. This foundation sets the stage for more complex features and functionalities, like API routes, styling, authentication, and more!NextjsWeb DevelopmentCodingTutorialDevelopment----FollowWritten by Mansour N2 Followers¬∑1 FollowingFollowNo responses yetHelpStatusAboutCareersPressBlogPrivacyRulesTermsText to speech"],"metadata":[{"description":"Welcome to Next.js, a React framework that‚Äôs gaining widespread popularity among web developers.

Tokens.  colors: {    text: \"#111\",    primary: \"#06f\",  },  fonts: {    body: \"system-ui, sans-serif\",    heading: \"system-ui,","\"#111\",    primary: \"#06f\",  },  fonts: {    body: \"system-ui, sans-serif\",    heading: \"system-ui, sans-serif\",  },  fontWeights: {    body: 400,    heading: 700,    bold: 700,  },","// 2.

You reference tokens using the token name and you can mix in any CSS properties.<section display=\"grid\" col=\"2\" py=\"10\">  <div>    <h1 variant=\"heading.h1\" color=\"primary\">{title}</h1>    <p variant=\"text.lead\">{text}</p>    <button bg=\"primary\" py=\"2\" px=\"4\" mt=\"4>Learn more</button>  </div>  <img src={image} alt=\"Alt text\" /></section> CopyCopyCreate a new projectCreate a new Next.js site using the nextjs-starter-typescript.npx create-next-app reflexjs-example -e https://github.com/reflexjs/nextjs-starter-typescript CopyCopyStart the development server:cd reflexjs-example CopyCopyyarn dev CopyCopyIf you open http://localhost:3000 in your browser, you should see the default landing page.Take a quick look at pages/index.tsx to see how this page is built.Directory StructureThe starter directory structure is intended to provide a great starting point for building your site.However, Reflexjs imposes","is intended to provide a great starting point for building your site.However, Reflexjs imposes no restrictions on how you organize your files.reflexjs-example  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pages  ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ index.tsx  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ public  ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ images  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ src      ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ theme.ts CopyCopyAdd a pageTo add a new page, create the file: pages/about.tsx with the following code:pages/about.tsxexport default function AboutPage() {  return <p>This is the about page</p>} CopyCopyNow open http://localhost:3000/about to see your new page.That's it.

For projects in the demos/ directory, you need to manually cd them and run pnpm install to install the dependencies.\nSo I configured the pnpm-workspace.yaml file as follows:\npackages:\n- \"packages/*\"\n\nHowever, when I cd into demos/projct-a and run pnpm install, I find that pnpm only updates the dependencies in the packages/ directory, and the dependency installation in project demos/project-a is completely ignored:\nroot@mac projct-a % pnpm install","Scope: all 5 workspace projects\nDone in 457ms\n\nI saw the article, but I can't use pnpm --ignore-workspace install because this project imports packages in packages/* by workspace.\n\n\n\n\npnpm-workspace\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\nImprove this question\n\n\n\n                        Follow\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            asked Apr 9 at 11:14\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhopgoldyhopgoldy\n\n9522 silver badges88 bronze badges\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd a comment\n¬†|¬†\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated questions\n\n\n\n\n                                3\n                            \n\nHow to trigger packages to build automatically when using pnpm install?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                3\n                            \n\nHow to run pnpm on a nested folder that is _not_ part of workspace setup?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                2\n                            \n\nEfficiently Managing Shared Dependencies and Binaries in a pnpm Monorepo Workspace\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated questions\n\n\n\n\n                                3","Related questions\n\n\n\n\n                                3\n                            \n\nHow to trigger packages to build automatically when using pnpm install?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                3\n                            \n\nHow to run pnpm on a nested folder that is _not_ part of workspace setup?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                2\n                            \n\nEfficiently Managing Shared Dependencies and Binaries in a pnpm Monorepo Workspace\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                0\n                            \n\nPnpm workspace config to publish pakcages under a specific directory only\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                2\n                            \n\npnpm node-linker in workspace\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                4\n                            \n\npnpm monorepo: how to set up a simple reusable (vue) component for reuse?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                0","0\n                            \n\nWhy is the node_modules link for my pnpm workspace sometimes the local package's root and sometime its dist folder?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                8\n                            \n\nPublish NPM package that uses a workspaces as dependencies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Load 5 more related questions\n                \n\n Show fewer related questions\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Sorted by:\n        \n\n            Reset to default\n        \n\n\n\n\n                        Highest score (default)\n                    \n\n                        Trending (recent votes count more)\n                    \n\n                        Date modified (newest first)\n                    \n\n                        Date created (oldest first)\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKnow someone who can answer?

Starting from version 7, pnpm supports auto-installing peer dependencies. Here's a guide to enabling this feature and ensuring a smooth development workflow.Why Auto-Install Peer Dependencies?Peer dependencies are essential for ensuring compatibility between packages. By enabling automatic installation, you can:Reduce manual dependency management.Avoid build errors caused by missing peer dependencies.Ensure consistency across development environments.How to Enable Auto-Installation of Peer DependenciesThere are two main ways to enable the auto-installation of peer dependencies in pnpm: using the .npmrc file or setting the","to enable the auto-installation of peer dependencies in pnpm: using the .npmrc file or setting the configuration via command line.Method 1: Configure .npmrcCreate or modify the .npmrc file in the root directory of your project, and add the following line:auto-install-peers=true","This ensures that all developers working on the project will have the same configuration.Method 2: Use the Command LineRun the following command to enable the auto-installation globally or locally:Globally:pnpm config set auto-install-peers true\nThis sets the configuration for all projects on your machine.Locally (per project):pnpm config set auto-install-peers true --location project\nThis creates or updates the .npmrc file in your project's root directory.Steps to Apply the ChangesAfter enabling auto-installation, follow these steps to ensure everything is properly set up:Remove Existing node_modulesrm -rf node_modules\nReinstall Dependencies Run the installation command to apply the configuration:pnpm install\nOptionally Use --shamefully-hoist If you encounter issues with peer dependencies, you can use the --shamefully-hoist flag:pnpm install --shamefully-hoist","FAQsWhat is the .npmrc file?The .npmrc file is a configuration file used by npm and pnpm to manage settings such as registries, authentication tokens, and behavior like auto-installing peer dependencies.Does enabling auto-install-peers modify my package.json?No, enabling auto-install-peers does not add peer dependencies to your package.json. It ensures they are installed in node_modules during the install process.How do I disable auto-installation of peer dependencies?To disable the feature, you can either delete the corresponding line from .npmrc or run:pnpm config delete auto-install-peers","Best PracticesCommit the .npmrc file: Ensure all developers working on the project have consistent behavior.Review peer dependencies: Use the auto-install-peers feature judiciously to maintain clarity on what dependencies your project explicitly uses.Stay Updated: Use the latest version of pnpm to benefit from improved peer dependency handling.ConclusionBy enabling the auto-installation of peer dependencies in pnpm, you can simplify your workflow and avoid potential issues caused by missing dependencies. Whether through a .npmrc file or command-line configuration, this feature ensures a smoother development experience for your team.Previous ArticleDifference Between pnpm create, pnpx, and dlxNext ArticleHow to fix the common pnpm error: Unable to find the global bin directory.‚Üê Back to the blogRipal & Zalak ‚Ä¢ ¬© 2025 ‚Ä¢ True Coder Guru"],"metadata":[{"description":"Learn how to configure pnpm to automatically install peer dependencies for streamlined project management.","embedding_config":"{\"engine\": \"\", \"model\": \"sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2\"}","language":"en-us","source":"https://truecoderguru.com/blog/pnpm/pnpm-auto-install-peer-dependencies","start_index":0,"title":"Auto-Installing Peer Dependencies in pnpm | True Coder Guru"},{"description":"Learn how to configure pnpm to automatically install peer dependencies for streamlined project management.","embedding_config":"{\"engine\": \"\", \"model\": \"sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2\"}","language":"en-us","source":"https://truecoderguru.com/blog/pnpm/pnpm-auto-install-peer-dependencies","start_index":898,"title":"Auto-Installing Peer Dependencies in pnpm | True Coder Guru"},{"description":"Learn how to configure pnpm to automatically install peer dependencies for streamlined project management.","embedding_config":"{\"engine\": \"\", \"model\": \"sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2\"}","language":"en-us","source":"https://truecoderguru.com/blog/pnpm/pnpm-auto-install-peer-dependencies","start_index":1177,"title":"Auto-Installing Peer Dependencies in pnpm | True Coder Guru"},{"description":"Learn how to configure pnpm to automatically install peer dependencies for streamlined project management.","embedding_config":"{\"engine\": \"\", \"model\": \"sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2\"}","language":"en-us","source":"https://truecoderguru.com/blog/pnpm/pnpm-auto-install-peer-dependencies","start_index":2051,"title":"Auto-Installing Peer Dependencies in pnpm | True Coder Guru"},{"description":"Learn how to configure pnpm to automatically install peer dependencies for streamlined project management.","embedding_config":"{\"engine\": \"\", \"model\": \"sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2\"}","language":"en-us","source":"https://truecoderguru.com/blog/pnpm/pnpm-auto-install-peer-dependencies","start_index":2650,"title":"Auto-Installing Peer Dependencies in pnpm | True Coder Guru"}]},{"source":{"collection_name":"web-search-19d560eeb16ea7bfc9595957e0aa7eaf15478addb700bdcf77c3","name":"Automating installation of required dev dependencies via pnpm","type":"web_search","urls":["https://pnpm.io/cli/add"]},"document":["pnpm add <pkg> | pnpm","Skip to main contentpnpmDocsBlogFAQBenchmarksCommunityMoreBlogFAQCommunityBenchmarks10.xNext10.x9.x8.xEnglishEnglishItaliano (61%)ÁÆÄ‰Ωì‰∏≠Êñá (99%)Êó•Êú¨Ë™û (86%)ÌïúÍµ≠Ïñ¥ (52%)Portugu√™s Brasileiro (61%)Ê≠£È´î‰∏≠Êñá (43%)–†—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–π (38%)–£–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω—Å—å–∫–∞ (80%)Fran√ßais (50%)T√ºrk√ße (28%)Espa√±ol (67%)Bahasa Indonesia (32%)Help Us Translateüß° Sponsor UsOpen CollectiveGitHub SponsorsCrypto DonationsSearchIntroductionUsageCLI commandsManage dependenciespnpm add <pkg>pnpm installpnpm updatepnpm removepnpm linkpnpm unlinkpnpm importpnpm rebuildpnpm prunepnpm fetchpnpm install-testpnpm dedupePatch dependenciesReview dependenciesRun scriptsManage environmentsInspect the storeManage cacheMisc.ConfigurationFeaturesRecipesAdvancedCLI commandsManage dependenciespnpm add <pkg>Version: 10.xOn this pagepnpm add <pkg>Installs a package and any packages that it depends on.\nBy default, any new package is installed as a production dependency.\nTL;DR‚Äã","By default, any new package is installed as a production dependency.\nTL;DR‚Äã\nCommandMeaningpnpm add saxSave to dependenciespnpm add -D saxSave to devDependenciespnpm add -O saxSave to optionalDependenciespnpm add -g sax Install package globallypnpm add sax@nextInstall from the next tagpnpm add sax@3.0.0Specify version 3.0.0\nSupported package locations‚Äã\nInstall from npm registry‚Äã\npnpm add package-name will install the latest version of package-name from\nthe npm registry by default.\nIf executed in a workspace, the command will first try to check whether other\nprojects in the workspace use the specified package.

It offers a collection of pre-styled components and design tokens, streamlining the development process.Next.JS is a JavaScript framework for building React-based web applications. It allows React components to be rendered on the server side ‚Äî by generating HTML content from the server side which helps improve performance and search engine optimization (SEO).To get started, first create your Next.JS project on your local machine.Step 1: Create a New Next.js ProjectCreating a new Next.js project. Open your terminal and run the following command:npx","Next.js ProjectCreating a new Next.js project. Open your terminal and run the following command:npx create-next-app@latest next-with-chakraA Next.js project directory called ` next-with-chakra ` is created. Enter this directory using ‚Äî `cd next-with-chakra`.Step 2: Install Chakra UI using the commandnpm i @chakra-ui/react @emotion/react @emotion/styled framer-motionAfter installing Chakra UI, you need to set up the ChakraProvider at the root of your application. This can be either in your index.jsx, index.tsx, or App.jsx depending on the framework you use.Using Next.Js navigate to your pages folder and execute step 3 as seen below.Step 3: Write the following code in your _app.js file:import * as React from 'react'// 1. import `ChakraProvider` componentimport { ChakraProvider } from '@chakra-ui/react'function App({Component, pageProps}) {  // 2. Wrap ChakraProvider at the root of your app  return (    <ChakraProvider>      <Component {...pageProps} />    </ChakraProvider>  );}export","app  return (    <ChakraProvider>      <Component {...pageProps} />    </ChakraProvider>  );}export default AppThe ChakraProvider component initializes chakra in your web application.Step 4: Start DevelopmentThe whole setup is complete and Chakra UI is successfully installed, run the command:npm run devOne of the interesting features of Chakra-UI is, that styles used in creating your user interfaces are present as React components, so all you need to do is; import a certain component you need and it is ready for use.In this article, you will see a few steps taken to create certain landing page sections using Chakra-UI with next.js.Navigation bar. When trying to stack your items in a nav bar horizontally one component can be really efficient this is the ‚ÄòHStack‚Äô component. The HStack or Horizontal stack component works in some ways like the CSS flexbox. Especially, in displaying items horizontally. The link components are used to create links that will navigate users to certain pages","The link components are used to create links that will navigate users to certain pages like the following:HomeAbout UsContactFAQimport React from \"react\";import {Heading, HStack, Spacer, Link, Flex, Button, Box} from \"@chakra-ui/react\";import NextLink from \"next/link\";      <Flex alignItems=\"center\">        <Heading as=\"h1\" size=\"lg\" color=\"#007BFF\" ml=\"20px\">          Navbar        </Heading>        <Spacer />        <HStack>          <Link color=\"#000\" as={NextLink} href=\"#\"> Home</Link>          <Link color=\"#000\" as={NextLink} href=\"#\">Services</Link>          <Link color=\"#000\" as={NextLink} href=\"#\">About Us</Link>          <Link color=\"#000\" as={NextLink} href=\"#\">Contact Us</Link>          <Link color=\"#000\" as={NextLink} href=\"#\">FAQ</Link>          <Button ml=\"100px\" bg=\"#FFF\" border=\"1px solid\" color=\"#007BFF\"  mt=\"10px\">Button</Button>          <Button ml=\"15px\" bg=\"#007BFF\" color=\"#FFF\" mt=\"10px\" mr=\"20px\">Button</Button>        </HStack>      </Flex>by authorCardIf a","color=\"#FFF\" mt=\"10px\" mr=\"20px\">Button</Button>        </HStack>      </Flex>by authorCardIf a section contains a card with a body, header, and footer. You can arrange the elements inside the card with the Chakra UI card component. By importing the card component and its child components such as the:CardBodyCardHeaderCardFooter.If necessary. To create a button inside the card. Import the button component. The button is created with Chakra generic styles, which can be tweaked to suit your wants.import React from \"react\";import {Heading, HStack, Spacer, Flex, Button, Card, CardBody, CardHeader, Stack} from \"@chakra-ui/react\";import NextLink from \"next/link\";      <Flex alignItems=\"center\">        <Text m=\"20px\">          Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit.

Icons with shaped backgrounds with colors are quite fun to create, Chakra has component icons that are very efficient, there is no need to import a third-party icon module. Import the shape component, inside the shape component use the icon components for each of the social media icons, Like so:import React from \"react\";import {HStack, Text, Link, Grid, GridItem, Circle, List, ListItem} from \"@chakra-ui/react\";import NextLink from \"next/link\";import { PhoneIcon } from \"@chakra-ui/icons\";import { EmailIcon } from \"@chakra-ui/icons\";      <Grid templateColumns=\"repeat(8, auto)\" mt=\"50px\">        <GridItem ml=\"20px\" colSpan=\"1\">          <Text fontSize=\"20px\" fontWeight=\"400px\">            Chakra-UI          </Text>          <List>             <Link as={NextLink} href=\"#\">","Chakra-UI          </Text>          <List>             <Link as={NextLink} href=\"#\">              <ListItem>Icons</ListItem>            </Link>            <Link as={NextLink} href=\"#\">              <ListItem>Components</ListItem>            </Link>            <Link as={NextLink} href=\"#\">              <ListItem>Styles</ListItem>            </Link>          </List>        </GridItem>        <GridItem colSpan=\"1\">          <Text fontSize=\"20px\" fontWeight=\"400px\">            Chakra-UI          </Text>          <List>            <Link as={NextLink} href=\"#\">              <ListItem>Icons</ListItem>            </Link>            <Link as={NextLink} href=\"#\">              <ListItem>Components</ListItem>            </Link>            <Link as={NextLink} href=\"#\">              <ListItem>Styles</ListItem>            </Link>          </List>        </GridItem>        <GridItem colSpan=\"1\">          <Text fontSize=\"20px\" fontWeight=\"400px\">            Chakra-UI          </Text>","<Text fontSize=\"20px\" fontWeight=\"400px\">            Chakra-UI          </Text>          <List>            <Link as={NextLink} href=\"#\">              <ListItem>Icons</ListItem>            </Link>            <Link as={NextLink} href=\"#\">              <ListItem>Components</ListItem>            </Link>            <Link as={NextLink} href=\"#\">              <ListItem>Styles</ListItem>            </Link>          </List>        </GridItem>        <GridItem colSpan=\"1\">          <Text fontSize=\"20px\" fontWeight=\"400px\">            Icon Media          </Text>          <Text>Avoid missing out, follow!</Text>          <HStack>            <Link as={NextLink} href=\"#\">              <Circle size=\"40px\" bg=\"#007BFF\" color=\"#FFF\">                <EmailIcon />              </Circle>            </Link>            <Link as={NextLink} href=\"#\">              <Circle size=\"40px\" bg=\"#007BFF\" color=\"#FFF\">                <PhoneIcon />              </Circle>            </Link>          </HStack>","<PhoneIcon />              </Circle>            </Link>          </HStack>        </GridItem>      </Grid>by authorConclusionIn summary, we have demonstrated how you can use Chakra UI inside your nextjs project to create sections like a navbar using the HStack component and the link component, a card with a header, body, and button using the card component, and creating a footer with Chakra UI icons and we have seen how effective the flex and grid components work in Chakra UI.Chakra UI is a powerful tool for creating visually appealing and accessible web applications.

This article will be focused on the problems I‚Äôve encountered and how I solved them.To begin with, I recommend that you read the information on the Storybook configuration from the official website to have a basic understanding.Configuration filesThe configuration","from the official website to have a basic understanding.Configuration filesThe configuration files are located in your project root fold .storybook, and the most important ones are main.js preview.js manager.js The main config file is main.js, there is a chance that you don‚Äôt need to config other files. This article will put more value on main.js and preview.jsmain.jsAs it is clearly stated in Storybook documentation:The main.js configuration file is a preset and as such has a powerful interface, but the key fields within it are:1. stories- an array of globs that indicates the location of your story files, relative to main.js.2. addons - a list of the addons you are using.3. webpackFinal - custom webpack configuration.4. babel - custom babel configuration.module.exports = {// The location of your stories  stories: ['../src/**/*.stories.@(js|mdx)'],// addons added to your storybook  addons: ['@storybook/addon-essentials'],// custom babel config    babel: async (options) => ({","addons: ['@storybook/addon-essentials'],// custom babel config    babel: async (options) => ({      ...options,      // any extra options you want to set  }),//  custom webpack configwebpackFinal: async (config, { configType }) => {    // `configType` has a value of 'DEVELOPMENT' or 'PRODUCTION'    // You can change the configuration based on that.    // 'PRODUCTION' is used when building the static version of storybook.    // Make whatever fine-grained changes you need    config.module.rules.push({      test: /\\.scss$/,      use: ['style-loader', 'css-loader', 'sass-loader'],      include: path.resolve(__dirname, '../'),    });    // Return the altered config    return config;  }}Tip 1: The Storybook has its default webpack configuration, when trying to import your current webpack config or add your own rules, DO use push to add your rules to the rules array, or mutable the config object.config.module.rules.push({      test: /\\.scss$/,      use: ['style-loader', 'css-loader',","object.config.module.rules.push({      test: /\\.scss$/,      use: ['style-loader', 'css-loader', 'sass-loader'],      include: path.resolve(__dirname, '../'),    });Config the necessary alias that already applies to your current project.config.resolve.alias = {    ...config.resolve.alias,    \"ui-components\": path.resolve(__dirname, \"../src\")};Tip 2: To check the final webpack config, you can run yarn storybook --debug-webpack to print the config in your terminal or you can add console.log(config.module.rules) inside webpackFinal function, and run yarn storybook to print only part of the final webpack config.Tip 3: Since version 6.0, Storybook add essential addons by default, including Docs, Controls, Actions, Viewport, Backgrounds, Toolbars. You can check the release note here.All you need is to add essential addons in config.addons: ['@storybook/addon-essentials']With docs and control addons, Arg Table/Props Table can be addedpreview.jsTo control the way stories are rendered and add","addons, Arg Table/Props Table can be addedpreview.jsTo control the way stories are rendered and add global decorators and parameters, create a .storybook/preview.js file. This is loaded in the Canvas tab, the ‚Äúpreview‚Äù iframe that renders your components in isolation. Use preview.js for global code (such as CSS imports or JavaScript mocks) that applies to all stories.The preview.js file can be an ES module and export the following keys:decorators - an array of global decoratorsparameters - an object of global parametersglobalTypes - definition of globalTypesIf you‚Äôre looking to change how your stories are ordered, read about sorting stories.Tip 4: preview.js is the file where you can also import the global css/sass, so it will apply the styles to your components.import ‚Äú../src/styles/theme.css‚Äù;Tip 5: If you have a top wrapper with a specific class name which has styles, you should add the same wrapper through decorator.import { addDecorator } from \"@storybook/react\";// For each","add the same wrapper through decorator.import { addDecorator } from \"@storybook/react\";// For each story, the parent element will be div with class name \"platform\"addDecorator(story => <div className=\"platform\">{story()}</div>);Tip 6: Any other global config or javascript mocks (formatters etc.) should be added in preview.jsimport { addDecorator } from \"@storybook/react\";import { withI18n } from \"storybook-addon-i18n\";addDecorator(withI18n);manager.jsThe manager.js is to control the behaviour of Storybook‚Äôs UI. You can set UI options and configure Storybook‚Äôs theme. It is optional and no need to add if your project doesn‚Äôt have the requirement for customised Storybook UI/theme.To concludeSince Storybook 6.0, the Storybook team makes it easier to configure, even though some of the config is missing or not written in a very detailed way in the documentation.

It also allows you to define and run scripts to automate various tasks within your project. One can make use of npm packages within your scripts to extend functionality. For instance, you can employ packages like cross-env to set environment variables cross-platform. These scripts are housed in the package.json file, which acts as a central configuration hub for npm-managed projects.\nWhy Choose NPM Scripts for Builds?In summary, npm scripts provide a lightweight yet powerful solution for automating your project builds. By defining simple commands in your package.json file, you can streamline your development workflow and spend more time coding and less time managing build tools.","Simplicity: NPM scripts offer a straightforward approach to building your projects. No need to juggle multiple build tools or configurations.Integration: Since npm scripts are part of the npm ecosystem, they seamlessly integrate with your existing workflow. No extra installations are NPM required!Customization: With npm scripts, you have the flexibility to tailor your build process to suit your project's unique requirements.Steps to create NPM scripts:Let's walk through the process of setting up npm scripts for a basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript project:\nInitialize a new npm project:Begin by initializing a new npm project within your project directory:\nnpm init -yThis command creates a package.json file with default settings.\nDefine your build scripts:For a simple project involving HTML, CSS, and JavaScript(code given below),  you can set up scripts to copy files from the src directory to the dist directory.","Now, let's define the npm script in the package.json file. Open package.json and add the following:\n\"scripts\": {  \"build\": \"mkdir -p dist && cp src/index.html dist/ && cp src/style.css dist/ && cp src/script.js dist/\"}Here, the build script creates a dist directory (if it doesn't exist) and copies the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files from the src directory to the dist directory.\nRun the Project:To run an HTML file with live-server, you can use the live-server package. First, you need to install it globally (if you haven't already) using npm:\nnpm install -g live-serverAfter installing live-server, you can use it to serve your HTML file by navigating to the directory containing your HTML file in your terminal and running:\nlive-serverThis command will start a local server and open your default web browser to display your HTML file. It also provides features like live reloading, so any changes you make to your HTML file","Note: You can also run this project By Right clicking on index.html file by clicking on \"Open with Live Server\"","Run your build script:Execute your build script using the npm run command followed by the script name:\nnpm run buildThis command triggers the defined build tasks, generating a distribution-ready version of your project in the dist directory.\nPackage.json file:\npackage.jsonFolder Structure:\nExample: To demonstrate creating an simple JavaScript project and using the npm script as build tool in it.\n\nHTML\n\n<!-- index.html -->\n\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" \n          content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n    <title>My Project</title>\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"style.css\">\n</head>\n\n<body>\n    <h1>GeeksforGeeks!</h1>\n    <script src=\"script.js\"></script>\n</body>\n\n</html>\n\n\nCSS\n\n/* style.css */\nbody {\n    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\n    background-color: #f0f0f0;\n}\n\nh1 {\n    color: green;\n}\n\n\nJavaScript\n\n//src/script.js\nconsole.log(\"Script loaded!\");\n\nOutput:\noutput","JavaScript\n\n//src/script.js\nconsole.log(\"Script loaded!\");\n\nOutput:\noutput\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n        Comment\r\n    More info\nAdvertise with us\n\n\n\nNext Article\n\n\n\n\nXML Namespaces\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nisandeep2183 \n\n\n\n\n\n Follow \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImprove\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArticle Tags : \n\n\nJavaScript\n\n\nWeb Technologies\n\n\nNode.js\n\n\nNode-npm\n \n\n\n\n\n\nSimilar Reads\n\n\nHow to Run, Configure, and Troubleshoot npm Scripts?\r\n                    \nnpm (Node Package Manager) is not only used for managing dependencies in Node.js projects but also provides a powerful script-running functionality. npm scripts allow you to automate various tasks such as running tests, building your project, deploying applications, and more.

However, as with any programming language, errors and exceptions are an inevitable part of the development process. Effective error handling is crucial for creating robust and reliable Python scripts.\nWhat is Error Handling?\nError handling in Python refers to the process of detecting, managing, and responding to errors that occur during the execution of a script. Errors can arise from a variety of sources, such as incorrect input, invalid data, or logical flaws in the code.\nImportance of Error Handling\nProper error handling is essential for several reasons:","Improved User Experience: By anticipating and handling errors gracefully, you can provide a better user experience by avoiding unexpected program crashes or confusing error messages.\nRobust and Reliable Code: Effective error handling helps ensure that your Python scripts can gracefully handle unexpected situations and continue running, rather than crashing or producing incorrect results.\nDebugging and Troubleshooting: Proper error handling can provide valuable information for debugging and troubleshooting, making it easier to identify and fix issues in your code.\n\nCommon Types of Errors in Python\nPython categorizes errors into two main types:","Common Types of Errors in Python\nPython categorizes errors into two main types:\n\nSyntax Errors: These occur when the Python interpreter encounters code that does not conform to the language's syntax rules. Syntax errors are typically caught and reported during the code execution process.\nExceptions: Exceptions are errors that occur during the execution of a script, such as trying to divide by zero, accessing an index out of range, or opening a file that does not exist. Exceptions can be handled using Python's built-in exception handling mechanisms.","Understanding the different types of errors and their characteristics is the first step towards implementing effective error handling in your Python scripts.\nImplementing Effective Error Handling Techniques\nTry-Except Blocks\nThe foundation of error handling in Python is the try-except block. This structure allows you to enclose a block of code that may raise an exception, and then handle the exception if it occurs.\ntry:\n    ## Code that may raise an exception\n    result = 10 / 0\nexcept ZeroDivisionError:\n    print(\"Error: Division by zero\")\nIn the example above, if a ZeroDivisionError occurs, the code inside the except block will be executed instead of the program crashing.\nHandling Multiple Exceptions\nYou can handle multiple exceptions in a single try-except block by specifying multiple except clauses.\ntry:\n    ## Code that may raise different exceptions\n    result = int(\"abc\")\nexcept ValueError:\n    print(\"Error: Invalid input\")\nexcept TypeError:","result = int(\"abc\")\nexcept ValueError:\n    print(\"Error: Invalid input\")\nexcept TypeError:\n    print(\"Error: Incompatible data types\")\nThis allows you to provide specific error handling for different types of exceptions that may occur.\nRaising Exceptions\nSometimes, you may need to raise your own exceptions to signal that a specific error condition has occurred. You can use the raise statement to do this.\ndef divide(a, b):\n    if b == 0:\n        raise ZeroDivisionError(\"Error: Division by zero\")\n    return a / b","try:\n    result = divide(10, 0)\nexcept ZeroDivisionError as e:\n    print(e)\nThis can be useful when you want to provide more informative error messages or when you need to create custom exception types.\nUsing the finally Clause\nThe finally clause in a try-except block ensures that a block of code is executed regardless of whether an exception was raised or not. This is useful for cleaning up resources, such as closing a file or database connection.\ntry:\n    file = open(\"file.txt\", \"r\")\n    content = file.read()\n    print(content)\nexcept FileNotFoundError:\n    print(\"Error: File not found\")\nfinally:\n    file.close()\nBy including the file closing logic in the finally clause, you can ensure that the file is properly closed even if an exception is raised.\nContextual Error Handling with with Statement","Contextual Error Handling with with Statement\nThe with statement provides a convenient way to handle resources that need to be properly acquired and released, such as file objects or database connections. It automatically takes care of the cleanup process, even in the presence of exceptions.\nwith open(\"file.txt\", \"r\") as file:\n    content = file.read()\n    print(content)\nIn the example above, the file is automatically closed when the with block is exited, regardless of whether an exception occurred or not.\nBy mastering these error handling techniques, you can create more robust and reliable Python scripts that can gracefully handle unexpected situations.\nBest Practices for Error Handling in Python Scripts\nCatch Specific Exceptions\nWhen handling exceptions, it's best to catch specific exception types rather than using a broad except clause. This allows you to provide more targeted and informative error handling.\ntry:\n    result = 10 / 0\nexcept ZeroDivisionError as e:","try:\n    result = 10 / 0\nexcept ZeroDivisionError as e:\n    print(f\"Error: {e}\")\nProvide Meaningful Error Messages\nWhen catching exceptions, take the time to provide clear and informative error messages that explain what went wrong and how the user can address the issue.\ntry:\n    file = open(\"non_existent_file.txt\", \"r\")\nexcept FileNotFoundError as e:\n    print(f\"Error: {e} - Please check the file path and try again.\")\nLog Errors for Debugging\nIn addition to providing user-friendly error messages, it's a good practice to log errors for debugging purposes. This can help you identify and fix issues more efficiently.\nimport logging","logging.basicConfig(level=logging.ERROR, filename=\"error.log\", format=\"%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s\")\n\ntry:\n    result = 10 / 0\nexcept ZeroDivisionError as e:\n    logging.error(f\"Error: {e}\")\n    print(\"An error occurred. Please check the log file for more details.\")\nHandle Exceptions at the Appropriate Level\nWhen designing your Python scripts, consider where to handle exceptions. Exceptions should be handled at the level where they can be most effectively addressed and where the appropriate context is available.\ndef divide(a, b):\n    try:\n        return a / b\n    except ZeroDivisionError as e:\n        raise ValueError(\"Cannot divide by zero\") from e","try:\n    result = divide(10, 0)\nexcept ValueError as e:\n    print(f\"Error: {e}\")\nIn this example, the divide function handles the ZeroDivisionError and raises a more meaningful ValueError exception, which is then caught and handled at the appropriate level.\nUse Context Managers for Resource Management\nUtilize context managers (the with statement) to ensure that resources, such as file handles or database connections, are properly acquired and released, even in the presence of exceptions.\nwith open(\"file.txt\", \"r\") as file:\n    content = file.read()\n    print(content)\nBy using the with statement, you can simplify your error handling and ensure that resources are cleaned up correctly.\nFollowing these best practices will help you create more robust, maintainable, and user-friendly Python scripts that can effectively handle errors and exceptions.\nSummary","Summary\nBy the end of this tutorial, you will have a comprehensive understanding of Python's error handling mechanisms, including how to use try-except blocks, handle different types of exceptions, and implement best practices for error handling in your Python scripts. This knowledge will empower you to write more resilient and maintainable Python applications that can effectively manage errors and provide a seamless user experience.","topicsLinuxDevOpsCybersecurityDatabaseDockerKubernetesGitShellNmapWiresharkHydraJavaBig DataSQLitePostgreSQLMySQLRedisMongoDBGolangC++CAnsibleData ScienceMachine LearningPandasNumPyscikit-learnMatplotlibWeb DevelopmentAlibaba CloudHTMLCSSJavaScriptReactKali LinuxshareRelated Python CoursesQuick Start with PythonLinuxPythonBeginnerThe Advanced Python MasteryLinuxPythonAdvancedPython Practice ChallengesPythonBeginnerSwitch LanguageLearn Linux, DevOps & Cybersecurity with Hands-on LabsLEARNING PATHLearn LinuxLearn DevOpsLearn CybersecurityLearn DatabaseLearn PythonLearn DockerLearn JavaLearn JenkinsLearn Machine LearningLearn Kali LinuxPROJECTS & TUTORIALSAll Interactive TutorialsLinux ProjectsPython ProjectsJava ProjectsNumpy ProjectsLinux TutorialDocker TutorialCybersecurity tutorialFree LabsLinux Commands Cheat SheetPLAYGROUNDSOnline Linux TerminalOnline Docker PlaygroundOnline Python PlaygroundOnline Golang PlaygroundOnline C++ PlaygroundOnline Java PlaygroundOnline Rust","Python PlaygroundOnline Golang PlaygroundOnline C++ PlaygroundOnline Java PlaygroundOnline Rust PlaygroundOnline MySQL PlaygroundOnline Ansible PlaygroundOnline Jenkins PlaygroundLATEST TUTORIALSPython Itertools CombinationsDocker Compose with Host NetworkSystemctl daemon-reload in LinuxMatch Patterns with Bash RegexDevOps Free LabsFind Key with Max Value in Python DictionaryLinux Free LabsBash Function Return ValuesArea and Circumference of a Circle in CCybersecurity Free LabsSUPPORT|CONTACT US|FORUM|INTERVIEW QUESTIONS|LABEX TEAMS|AFFILIATE |SITEMAP|PRIVACY POLICY|TERMS OF SERVICE ¬© 2017-2025 LabEx Technology Limited All Rights Reserved"],"metadata":[{"description":"Discover how to implement effective error handling techniques in your Python scripts.

Exception handling allows to respond to the error, instead of crashing the running program. It enables you to catch and manage errors, making your code more robust and user-friendly. Let‚Äôs look at an example:\nHandling a Simple Exception in PythonException handling helps in preventing crashes due to errors. Here‚Äôs a basic example demonstrating how to catch an exception and handle it gracefully:\n\nPython\n\n# Simple Exception Handling Example\nn = 10\ntry:\n    res = n / 0  # This will raise a ZeroDivisionError\n    \nexcept ZeroDivisionError:\n    print(\"Can't be divided by zero!\")","OutputCan't be divided by zero!\nExplanation: In this example, dividing number by 0 raises a ZeroDivisionError. The try block contains the code that might cause an exception and the except block handles the exception, printing an error message instead of stopping the program.\n\nDifference Between Exception and ErrorError: Errors are serious issues that a program should not try to handle. They are usually problems in the code‚Äôs logic or configuration and need to be fixed by the programmer. Examples include syntax errors and memory errors.Exception: Exceptions are less severe than errors and can be handled by the program. They occur due to situations like invalid input, missing files or network issues.Example:\n\nPython\n\n# Syntax Error (Error)\nprint(\"Hello world\"  # Missing closing parenthesis\n\n# ZeroDivisionError (Exception)\nn = 10\nres = n / 0","Explanation: A syntax error is a coding mistake that prevents the code from running. In contrast, an exception like ZeroDivisionError can be managed during the program‚Äôs execution using exception handling.\nSyntax and UsageException handling in Python is done using the try, except, else and finally blocks.\ntry:      # Code that might raise an exceptionexcept SomeException:      # Code to handle the exceptionelse:     # Code to run if no exception occursfinally:    # Code to run regardless of whether an exception occurs","try, except, else and finally Blockstry Block: try block lets us test a block of code for errors. Python will ‚Äútry‚Äù to execute the code in this block. If an exception occurs, execution will immediately jump to the except block.except Block: except block enables us to handle the error or exception. If the code inside the try block throws an error, Python jumps to the except block and executes it. We can handle specific exceptions or use a general except to catch all exceptions.else Block: else block is optional and if included, must follow all except blocks. The else block runs only if no exceptions are raised in the try block. This is useful for code that should execute if the try block succeeds.finally Block: finally block always runs, regardless of whether an exception occurred or not. It is typically used for cleanup operations (closing files, releasing resources).Example:","Python\n\ntry:\n    n = 0\n    res = 100 / n\n    \nexcept ZeroDivisionError:\n    print(\"You can't divide by zero!\")\n    \nexcept ValueError:\n    print(\"Enter a valid number!\")\n    \nelse:\n    print(\"Result is\", res)\n    \nfinally:\n    print(\"Execution complete.\")","OutputYou can't divide by zero!\nExecution complete.\nExplanation:\ntry block asks for user input and tries to divide 100 by the input number.except blocks handle ZeroDivisionError and ValueError.else block runs if no exception occurs, displaying the result.finally block runs regardless of the outcome, indicating the completion of execution.Common Exceptions in PythonPython has many built-in exceptions, each representing a specific error condition. Some common ones include:","Exception NameDescriptionBaseExceptionThe base class for all built-in exceptions.ExceptionThe base class for all non-exit exceptions.ArithmeticErrorBase class for all errors related to arithmetic operations.ZeroDivisionErrorRaised when a division or modulo operation is performed with zero as the divisor.OverflowErrorRaised when a numerical operation exceeds the maximum limit of a data type.FloatingPointErrorRaised when a floating-point operation fails.AssertionErrorRaised when an assert statement fails.AttributeErrorRaised when an attribute reference or assignment fails.IndexErrorRaised when a sequence subscript is out of range.KeyErrorRaised when a dictionary key is not found.MemoryErrorRaised when an operation runs out of memory.NameErrorRaised when a local or global name is not found.OSErrorRaised when a system-related operation (like file I/O) fails.TypeErrorRaised when an operation or function is applied to an object of inappropriate type.ValueErrorRaised when a function receives","or function is applied to an object of inappropriate type.ValueErrorRaised when a function receives an argument of the right type but inappropriate value.ImportErrorRaised when an import statement has issues.ModuleNotFoundErrorRaised when a module cannot be found.Python Catching ExceptionsWhen working with exceptions in Python, we can handle errors more efficiently by specifying the types of exceptions we expect. This can make code both safer and easier to debug.","Catching Specific ExceptionsCatching specific exceptions makes code to respond to different exception types differently. \nExample:","Python\n\ntry:\n    x = int(\"str\")  # This will cause ValueError\n    \n    #inverse\n    inv = 1 / x\n    \nexcept ValueError:\n    print(\"Not Valid!\")\n    \nexcept ZeroDivisionError:\n    print(\"Zero has no inverse!\")\n\nOutputNot Valid!\nExplanation:\nThe ValueError is caught because the string ‚Äústr‚Äù cannot be converted to an integer.If x were 0 and conversion successful, the ZeroDivisionError would be caught when attempting to calculate its inverse.Catching Multiple ExceptionsWe can catch multiple exceptions in a single block if we need to handle them in the same way or we can separate them if different types of exceptions require different handling.\nExample:\n\nPython\n\na = [\"10\", \"twenty\", 30]  # Mixed list of integers and strings\ntry:\n    total = int(a[0]) + int(a[1])  # 'twenty' cannot be converted to int\n    \nexcept (ValueError, TypeError) as e:\n    print(\"Error\", e)\n    \nexcept IndexError:\n    print(\"Index out of range.\")","OutputError invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'twenty'\nExplanation:\nThe ValueError is caught when trying to convert ‚Äútwenty‚Äù to an integer.TypeError might occur if the operation was incorrectly applied to non-integer types, but it‚Äôs not triggered in this specific setup.IndexError would be caught if an index outside the range of the list was accessed, but in this scenario, it‚Äôs under control.Catch-All Handlers and Their RisksHere‚Äôs a simple calculation that may fail due to various reasons.\nExample:\n\nPython\n\ntry:\n    # Simulate risky calculation: incorrect type operation\n    res = \"100\" / 20\n    \nexcept ArithmeticError:\n    print(\"Arithmetic problem.\")\n    \nexcept:\n    print(\"Something went wrong!\")","OutputSomething went wrong!\nExplanation:\nAn ArithmeticError (more specific like ZeroDivisionError) might be caught if this were a number-to-number division error. However, TypeError is actually triggered here due to attempting to divide a string by a number.catch-all except: is used to catch the TypeError, demonstrating the risk that the programmer might not realize the actual cause of the error (type mismatch) without more detailed error logging.Raise an ExceptionWe raise an exception in Python using the raise keyword followed by an instance of the exception class that we want to trigger. We can choose from built-in exceptions or define our own custom exceptions by inheriting from Python‚Äôs built-in Exception class.\nBasic Syntax:\nraise ExceptionType(‚ÄúError message‚Äù)\nExample:\n\nPython\n\ndef set(age):\n    if age < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Age cannot be negative.\")\n    print(f\"Age set to {age}\")\n\ntry:\n    set(-5)\nexcept ValueError as e:\n    print(e)","OutputAge cannot be negative.\nExplanation:","The function set checks if the age is negative. If so, it raises a ValueError with a message explaining the issue.This ensures that the age attribute cannot be set to an invalid state, thus maintaining the integrity of the data.Advantages of Exception Handling:Improved program reliability: By handling exceptions properly, you can prevent your program from crashing or producing incorrect results due to unexpected errors or input.Simplified error handling: Exception handling allows you to separate error handling code from the main program logic, making it easier to read and maintain your code.Cleaner code: With exception handling, you can avoid using complex conditional statements to check for errors, leading to cleaner and more readable code.Easier debugging: When an exception is raised, the Python interpreter prints a traceback that shows the exact location where the exception occurred, making it easier to debug your code.Disadvantages of Exception Handling:Performance overhead:","making it easier to debug your code.Disadvantages of Exception Handling:Performance overhead: Exception handling can be slower than using conditional statements to check for errors, as the interpreter has to perform additional work to catch and handle the exception.Increased code complexity: Exception handling can make your code more complex, especially if you have to handle multiple types of exceptions or implement complex error handling logic.Possible security risks: Improperly handled exceptions can potentially reveal sensitive information or create security vulnerabilities in your code, so it‚Äôs important to handle exceptions carefully and avoid exposing too much information about your program.","Comment\r\n    More info\nAdvertise with us\n\n\n\nNext Article\n\n\n\n\nUser-defined Exceptions in Python with Examples\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nN \n\n\n\nNikhil Kumar Singh\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImprove\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArticle Tags : \n\n\nPython\n\n\nSchool Programming\n \n\n\nPractice Tags : \n\npython \n\n\n\n\n\nSimilar Reads\n\n\nDecorators in Python\r\n                    \nIn Python, decorators are a powerful and flexible way to modify or extend the behavior of functions or methods, without changing their actual code.

They fetch data and manage state. Component tests allow you to verify these functional aspects of UIs.","In a nutshell, you start by supplying the appropriate props for the initial state of a component. Then simulate user behavior such as clicks and form entries. Finally, check whether the UI and component state update correctly.\nIn Storybook, this familiar workflow happens in your browser. That makes it easier to debug failures because you're running tests in the same environment as you develop components: the browser.","How does component testing in Storybook work?\nYou start by writing a story to set up the component's initial state. Then simulate user behavior using the play function. Finally, use the test-runner to confirm that the component renders correctly and that your component tests with the play function pass. The test runner can run via the command line or in CI.\n\nThe play function is a small snippet of code that runs after a story finishes rendering. You can use this to test user workflows.\nThe test is written using Storybook-instrumented versions of Vitest and Testing Library coming from the @storybook/test package.\n@storybook/addon-interactions visualizes the test in Storybook and provides a playback interface for convenient browser-based debugging.\n@storybook/test-runner is a standalone utility‚Äîpowered by Jest and Playwright‚Äîthat executes all of your interactions tests and catches broken stories.","The experimental Vitest plugin is also available, which transforms your stories into Vitest tests and runs them in a browser.\n\n\n\nSet up the interactions addon\nTo enable the full component testing experience with Storybook, you'll need to take additional steps to set it up properly. We recommend you go through the test runner documentation before proceeding with the rest of the required configuration.\nRun the following command to install the interactions addon and related dependencies.\n\n npmnpm install @storybook/test @storybook/addon-interactions --save-dev\n\nUpdate your Storybook configuration (in .storybook/main.js|ts) to include the interactions addon.","Update your Storybook configuration (in .storybook/main.js|ts) to include the interactions addon.\n\n .storybook/main.tsTypescript// Replace your-framework with the framework you are using (e.g., react-webpack5, vue3-vite)\nimport type { StorybookConfig } from '@storybook/your-framework';\n \nconst config: StorybookConfig = {\n  framework: '@storybook/your-framework',\n  stories: ['../src/**/*.mdx', '../src/**/*.stories.@(js|jsx|mjs|ts|tsx)'],\n  addons: [\n    // Other Storybook addons\n    '@storybook/addon-interactions', // üëà Register the addon\n  ],\n};\n \nexport default config;\n\nWrite a component test\nThe test itself is defined inside a play function connected to a story. Here's an example of how to set up a component test with Storybook and the play function:","LoginForm.stories.ts|tsxTypescriptimport type { Meta, StoryObj } from '@storybook/react';\n \nimport { userEvent, within, expect } from '@storybook/test';\n \nimport { LoginForm } from './LoginForm';\n \nconst meta: Meta<typeof LoginForm> = {\n  component: LoginForm,\n};\n \nexport default meta;\ntype Story = StoryObj<typeof LoginForm>;\n \nexport const EmptyForm: Story = {};\n \n/*\n * See https://storybook.js.org/docs/writing-stories/play-function#working-with-the-canvas\n * to learn more about using the canvasElement to query the DOM\n */\nexport const FilledForm: Story = {\n  play: async ({ canvasElement }) => {\n    const canvas = within(canvasElement);\n \n    // üëá Simulate interactions with the component\n    await userEvent.type(canvas.getByTestId('email'), 'email@provider.com');\n \n    await userEvent.type(canvas.getByTestId('password'), 'a-random-password');\n \n    // See https://storybook.js.org/docs/essentials/actions#automatically-matching-args to learn how to setup logging in the Actions panel","await userEvent.click(canvas.getByRole('button'));\n \n    // üëá Assert DOM structure\n    await expect(\n      canvas.getByText(\n        'Everything is perfect. Your account is ready and we should probably get you started!',\n      ),\n    ).toBeInTheDocument();\n  },\n};","Once the story loads in the UI, it simulates the user's behavior and verifies the underlying logic.","Run code before the component gets rendered\nYou can execute code before rendering by using the mount function in the play method.Here's an example of using the mockdate package to mock the Date, a useful way to make your story render in a consistent state. Page.stories.tsTypescriptimport MockDate from 'mockdate';\n \n// ...rest of story file\n \nexport const ChristmasUI: Story = {\n  async play({ mount }) {\n    MockDate.set('2024-12-25');\n    // üëá Render the component with the mocked date\n    await mount();\n    // ...rest of test\n  },\n};‚ö†Ô∏èThere are two requirements to use the mount function:\nYou must destructure the mount property from the context (the argument passed to your play function). This makes sure that Storybook does not start rendering the story before the play function begins.","Your Storybook framework or builder must be configured to transpile to ES2017 or newer. This is because destructuring statements and async/await usages are otherwise transpiled away, which prevents Storybook from recognizing your usage of mount.\nCreate mock data before renderingYou can also use mount to create mock data that you want to pass to the component. To do so, first create your data in the play function and then call the mount function with a component configured with that data. In this example, we create a mock note and pass its id to the Page component, which we call mount with. Page.stories.tsxTypescriptexport const Default: Story = {\n  play: async ({ mount, args }) => {\n    const note = await db.note.create({\n      data: { title: 'Mount inside of play' },\n    });\n \n    const canvas = await mount(\n      // üëá Pass data that is created inside of the play function to the component\n      //   For example, a just-generated UUID","//   For example, a just-generated UUID\n      <Page {...args} params={{ id: String(note.id) }} />,\n    );\n \n    await userEvent.click(await canvas.findByRole('menuitem', { name: /login to add/i }));\n  },\n  argTypes: {\n    // üëá Make the params prop un-controllable, as the value is always overriden in the play function.\n    params: { control: { disable: true } },\n  },\n};‚ÑπÔ∏èWhen you call mount() with no arguments, the component is rendered using the story‚Äôs render function, whether the implicit default or the explicit custom definition.When you mount a specific component inside the mount function like in the example above, the story‚Äôs render function will be ignored. This is why you must forward the args to the component.","Run code before each story in a file\nSometimes you might need to run the same code before each story in a file. For instance, you might need to set up the initial state of the component or modules. You can do this by adding an asynchronous beforeEach function to the component meta.\nYou can return a cleanup function from the beforeEach function, which will run after each story, when the story is remounted or navigated away from.\n‚ÑπÔ∏èGenerally, you should reset component and module state in the preview file's beforeAll or beforeEach functions, to ensure it applies to your entire project. However, if a component's needs are particularly unique, you can use the returned cleanup function in the component meta beforeEach to reset the state as needed.","Page.stories.tsTypescript// Replace your-renderer with the name of your renderer (e.g. react, vue3)\nimport type { Meta, StoryObj } from '@storybook/your-renderer';\nimport MockDate from 'mockdate';\n \n// üëá Must include the `.mock` portion of filename to have mocks typed correctly\nimport { getUserFromSession } from '#api/session.mock';\nimport { Page } from './Page';\n \nconst meta: Meta<typeof Page> = {\n  component: Page,\n  // üëá Set the value of Date for every story in the file\n  async beforeEach() {\n    MockDate.set('2024-02-14');\n \n    // üëá Reset the Date after each story\n    return () => {\n      MockDate.reset();\n    };\n  },\n};\nexport default meta;\n \ntype Story = StoryObj<typeof Page>;\n \nexport const Default: Story = {\n  async play({ canvasElement }) {\n    // ... This will run with the mocked Date\n  },\n};","Set up or reset state for all tests\nWhen you alter a component's state, it's important to reset that state before rendering another story to maintain isolation between tests.\nThere are two options for resetting state, beforeAll and beforeEach.\nbeforeAll\nThe beforeAll function in the preview file (.storybook/preview.js|ts) will run once before any stories in the project and will not re-run between stories. Beyond its initial run when kicking off a test run, it will not run again unless the preview file is updated. This is a good place to bootstrap your project or run any setup that your entire project depends on, as in the example below.\nYou can return a cleanup function from the beforeAll function, which will run before re-running the beforeAll function or during the teardown process in the test runner.",".storybook/preview.tsTypescript// Replace your-renderer with the renderer you are using (e.g., react, vue3, angular, etc.)\nimport { Preview } from '@storybook/your-renderer';\n \nimport { init } from '../project-bootstrap';\n \nconst preview: Preview = {\n  async beforeAll() {\n    await init();\n  },\n};\n \nexport default preview;\n\n\nbeforeEach\nUnlike beforeAll, which runs only once, the beforeEach function in the preview file (.storybook/preview.js|ts) will run before each story in the project. This is best used for resetting state or modules that are used by all or most of your stories.

These APIs improve your testing experience, helping you assert whether a function has been called, if an element exists in the DOM, and much more. If you are used to expect from testing packages such as Jest or Vitest, you can write component tests in much the same way.","Form.stories.ts|tsxTypescript// Replace your-framework with the name of your framework\nimport type { Meta, StoryObj } from '@storybook/your-framework';\n \nimport { userEvent, waitFor, within, expect, fn } from '@storybook/test';\n \nimport { Form } from './Form';\n \nconst meta: Meta<typeof Form> = {\n  component: Form,\n  args: {\n    // üëá Use `fn` to spy on the onSubmit arg\n    onSubmit: fn(),\n  },\n};\n \nexport default meta;\ntype Story = StoryObj<typeof Form>;\n \n/*\n * See https://storybook.js.org/docs/writing-stories/play-function#working-with-the-canvas\n * to learn more about using the canvasElement to query the DOM\n */\nexport const Submitted: Story = {\n  play: async ({ args, canvasElement, step }) => {\n    const canvas = within(canvasElement);\n \n    await step('Enter credentials', async () => {\n      await userEvent.type(canvas.getByTestId('email'), 'hi@example.com');\n      await userEvent.type(canvas.getByTestId('password'), 'supersecret');\n    });","await userEvent.type(canvas.getByTestId('password'), 'supersecret');\n    });\n \n    await step('Submit form', async () => {\n      await userEvent.click(canvas.getByRole('button'));\n    });\n \n    // üëá Now we can assert that the onSubmit arg was called\n    await waitFor(() => expect(args.onSubmit).toHaveBeenCalled());\n  },\n};","Group interactions with the step function\nFor complex flows, it can be worthwhile to group sets of related interactions together using the step function.

That gives teams a universal reference point to test and debug stories.\nExecute tests with the test-runner\nStorybook only runs the component test when you're viewing a story. Therefore, you'd have to go through each story to run all your checks. As your Storybook grows, it becomes unrealistic to review each change manually.

The biggest benefit is the ability to view the component you're testing in a real browser.

Please see below the list of ideas I tried from the community.\nI began by following this stack overflow idea. This involves selecting the Kind and Story based on the url parameter to identify the story to land on, but this did not work in our case.\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/53724555/specify-default-page-for-storybook\nThis approach also specifies using the addOnAPI from storybook addOns, to always choose the landing page to be the introduction mdx file. This did not work.\n¬†\n\nI followed the 2nd top answer suggesting to change main.js","I followed the 2nd top answer suggesting to change main.js\n\n¬†\nmodule.exports = {  stories: [    \"./Introduction.stories.mdx\",    \"../components//.stories.tsx\"  ],  addons: [    \"@storybook/addon-links\",    \"@storybook/addon-essentials\"  ]}\nThe default page issue was still not resolved. Later I noticed that this path was already configured properly as when I open storybook , the introduction page showed at top of other component stories.\n¬†\n¬†\n\nI tried following the 1st top answer with different values in¬†\n\n¬†\nstorybookAPI.selectStory('FirstKind', 'default story');\nto match the appropriate story name. It still didn't resolve the issue. So I tried selecting a different component story to check if it can set other components as default. It didn't work.\n¬†\n\nI looked for another solution:\nhttps://dev.to/committedsw/storybook-docs-first-page-1ick\n\nIt too didn't work","It too didn't work\n¬†\n\n\nI looked for storybook official docs and looked through all the related docs and found no exact clue about setting up default page loading. https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/configure/overview\n\n\nI looked into the storybook addons docs¬†https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/addons/writing-addons¬† but found no useful info.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeta\nWas this translation helpful?\nGive feedback.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n3\n You must be logged in to vote\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nAll reactions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplies: \n\n      4 comments\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n \nOldest\n\n\n\n\n \nNewest\n\n\n\n\n \nTop\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nComment options\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nQuote reply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndimitrieh\n\n\nOct 27, 2021\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n -\n           \n \n\n\n\n\n\nUnsure if this solves your usecase but you can make the first story and first page of it a documentation only page with https://storybook.js.org/addons/@storybook/addon-docs\n\n\n\n\n\nBeta\nWas this translation helpful?\nGive feedback.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n1\n You must be logged in to vote","1\n You must be logged in to vote\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nAll reactions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    0 replies\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nComment options\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nQuote reply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nshilman\n\n\nOct 28, 2021\n\n\n\n  Maintainer\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n -\n           \n \n\n\n\n\n\nStorybook shows the first story by default and the suggested approach is to make your first story a documentation page. When you navigate to the storybook, it shows this by default. One thing to note is that if you are running Storybook in dev mode (e.g. npm run storybook) and you have already been browsing a Storybook in your browser, it can reuse a tab that already has some other path selected (the last story you were browsing? i'm not sure whether this is a bug or something we have control over?). If you explicitly navigate to the path of the storybook (e.g. https://localhost:<port> where port is typically 6006 by default), it should show the first page.","Beta\nWas this translation

This approach enables developers to thoroughly test their components' functionality, responsiveness, and","approach enables developers to thoroughly test their components' functionality, responsiveness, and visual appearance across different scenarios, resulting in more robust and reliable applications.","With Cypress\nCypress is an end-to-end testing framework. It enables you to test a complete instance of your application by simulating user behavior. With Component Story Format, your stories are reusable with Cypress. Each named export (in other words, a story) is renderable within your testing setup.\nAn example of an end-to-end test with Cypress and Storybook is testing a login component for the correct inputs. For example, if you had the following story:","LoginForm.stories.ts|tsxTypescriptimport type { Meta, StoryObj } from '@storybook/react';\n \nimport { userEvent, within, expect } from '@storybook/test';\n \nimport { LoginForm } from './LoginForm';\n \nconst meta: Meta<typeof LoginForm> = {\n  component: LoginForm,\n};\n \nexport default meta;\ntype Story = StoryObj<typeof LoginForm>;\n \nexport const EmptyForm: Story = {};\n \n/*\n * See https://storybook.js.org/docs/writing-stories/play-function#working-with-the-canvas\n * to learn more about using the canvasElement to query the DOM\n */\nexport const FilledForm: Story = {\n  play: async ({ canvasElement }) => {\n    const canvas = within(canvasElement);\n \n    // üëá Simulate interactions with the component\n    await userEvent.type(canvas.getByTestId('email'), 'email@provider.com');\n \n    await userEvent.type(canvas.getByTestId('password'), 'a-random-password');\n \n    // See https://storybook.js.org/docs/essentials/actions#automatically-matching-args to learn how to setup logging in the Actions panel","await userEvent.click(canvas.getByRole('button'));\n \n    // üëá Assert DOM structure\n    await expect(\n      canvas.getByText(\n        'Everything is perfect. Your account is ready and we should probably get you started!',\n      ),\n    ).toBeInTheDocument();\n  },\n};","üí°The play function contains small snippets of code that run after the story renders. It allows you to sequence interactions in stories.\nWith Cypress, you could write the following test:\n\n /cypress/integration/Login.spec.js/// <reference types=\"cypress\" />\n \ndescribe('Login Form', () => {\n  it('Should contain valid login information', () => {\n    cy.visit('/iframe.html?id=components-login-form--example');\n    cy.get('#login-form').within(() => {\n      cy.log('**enter the email**');\n      cy.get('#email').should('have.value', 'email@provider.com');\n      cy.log('**enter password**');\n      cy.get('#password').should('have.value', 'a-random-password');\n    });\n  });\n});\n\nWhen Cypress runs your test, it loads Storybook's isolated iframe and checks if the inputs match the test values.","With Playwright\nPlaywright is a browser automation tool and end-to-end testing framework from Microsoft. It offers cross-browser automation, mobile testing with device emulation, and headless testing. With Component Story Format, your stories are reusable with Playwright. Each named export (in other words, a story) is renderable within your testing setup.\nA real-life scenario of user flow testing with Playwright would be how to test a login form for validity. For example, if you had the following story already created:","LoginForm.stories.ts|tsxTypescriptimport type { Meta, StoryObj } from '@storybook/react';\n \nimport { userEvent, within, expect } from '@storybook/test';\n \nimport { LoginForm } from './LoginForm';\n \nconst meta: Meta<typeof LoginForm> = {\n  component: LoginForm,\n};\n \nexport default meta;\ntype Story = StoryObj<typeof LoginForm>;\n \nexport const EmptyForm: Story = {};\n \n/*\n * See https://storybook.js.org/docs/writing-stories/play-function#working-with-the-canvas\n * to learn more about using the canvasElement to query the DOM\n */\nexport const FilledForm: Story = {\n  play: async ({ canvasElement }) => {\n    const canvas = within(canvasElement);\n \n    // üëá Simulate interactions with the component\n    await userEvent.type(canvas.getByTestId('email'), 'email@provider.com');\n \n    await userEvent.type(canvas.getByTestId('password'), 'a-random-password');\n \n    // See https://storybook.js.org/docs/essentials/actions#automatically-matching-args to learn how to setup logging in the Actions panel","await userEvent.click(canvas.getByRole('button'));\n \n    // üëá Assert DOM structure\n    await expect(\n      canvas.getByText(\n        'Everything is perfect.

2024--18ListenShareI‚Äôve worked on Next.js applications that scaled to over 100k monthly active users and landing pages with millions of monthly visitors. In this article, I‚Äôll share all the lessons I‚Äôve learned through countless iterations.Whether you‚Äôre part of a small team of one, two, or three developers, or you work on a massive Next.js project with multiple teams on the same codebase, it‚Äôs critical to get the foundation of your app right from the start. Even if you‚Äôre working on an existing project, you will discover some hard-earned insights that you can apply to your app today.Let me take you by the hand and show you all the steps and packages that you want to set up and explain to you why they‚Äôre useful, so your app scales smoothly.Initialize Your ProjectBegin by creating a new","you why they‚Äôre useful, so your app scales smoothly.Initialize Your ProjectBegin by creating a new Next.js project.npx create-next-app@latestIt may ask you if it can install the latest create-next-app version, just hit yes.Need to install the following packages:create-next-app@15.0.0Ok to proceed?

Discuss choices like using semicolons, quote styles, and tabs versus spaces with your team.Then use tools to enforce your style guide and format code automatically.There are two tools for that: Prettier and ESLint.PrettierPrettier is an opinionated code formatter that eliminates style","that: Prettier and ESLint.PrettierPrettier is an opinionated code formatter that eliminates style discussions during code reviews.Install Prettier together with its Tailwind plugin.npm install --save-dev prettier prettier-plugin-tailwindcssCreate aprettier.config.js file with your preferred rules.module.exports = {  arrowParens: 'avoid',  bracketSameLine: false,  bracketSpacing: true,  htmlWhitespaceSensitivity: 'css',  insertPragma: false,  jsxSingleQuote: false,  plugins: ['prettier-plugin-tailwindcss'],  printWidth: 80,  proseWrap: 'always',  quoteProps: 'as-needed',  requirePragma: false,  semi: true,  singleQuote: true,  tabWidth: 2,  trailingComma: 'all',  useTabs: false,};Add a formatting script to your package.json.\"format\": \"prettier --write .\",Run the formatter to apply your style.$ npm run format> nextjs-for-production@0.1.0 format> prettier --write .next.config.mjs 4ms (unchanged)package-lock.json 54ms (unchanged)package.json 1ms (unchanged)postcss.config.mjs 2ms","4ms (unchanged)package-lock.json 54ms (unchanged)package.json 1ms (unchanged)postcss.config.mjs 2ms (unchanged)README.md 20ms (unchanged)src/app/globals.css 17ms (unchanged)src/app/layout.tsx 30ms (unchanged)src/app/page.tsx 11ms (unchanged)tailwind.config.ts 2ms (unchanged)tsconfig.json 2ms (unchanged)Your files are now ‚Äúprettier‚Äù, but you also want to use ESLint.ESLintESLint can scan your code for both stylistic and logical issues.

For detailed descriptions, visit their respective GitHub pages.But in short, they enforce coding standards, organize imports, and ensure correct use of modern JavaScript features. Since ESLint and Prettier can conflict, this setup makes them work together smoothly. The plugins also help prevent bugs and keep styles consistent,","makes them work together smoothly. The plugins also help prevent bugs and keep styles consistent, especially with tools like Vitest and Playwright.Add a linting script to your package.json.\"lint:fix\": \"next lint --fix\",Run it to format all files according to your new rules.$ npm run lint:fix> nextjs-for-production@0.1.0 lint:fix> next lint --fix‚úî No ESLint warnings or errorsIf you get a TypeScript version warning, you can ignore that.Note: As of this article‚Äôs writing, ESLint 9 is available, but this tutorial uses ESLint 8 because many plugins do not yet support the latest version.CommitlintWhen collaborating with a large team, it‚Äôs also helpful to enforce consistent commit messages to keep the project history clear. By choosing the right standards, you can automate changelog and release generation with correct semantic versioning.Install Commitlint and its necessary configurations.

You avoid scrolling up and down in your file list to find all the files you need.Collaboration: Developers can focus on specific features without disrupting others‚Äô work.Onboarding: New developers understand the project structure faster, as all files for a feature are in one place.Refactoring: Updating a feature is streamlined since all its elements are grouped together.Modularity: Features can be reused, shared, or turned into standalone packages more easily.Micro-frontends: If your application ever grows to 30 or more engineers, it is easy to refactor to micro-frontends.Here is a more concrete example.src/‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app/‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ...‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ (group)/‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ about/‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ page.tsx‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ settings/‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ page.tsx‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ layout.tsx‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dashboard/‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ page.tsx‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ layout.tsx‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ layout.tsx‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ page.tsx‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ...‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ header/‚îÇ","‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ layout.tsx‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ layout.tsx‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ page.tsx‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ...‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ header/‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ header-component.tsx‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ header-component.test.ts‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ header.module.css‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ features/‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ...‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ todos/‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ...‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ todos-component.tsx‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ todos-component.test.ts‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ todos-container.ts‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ todos-reducer.ts‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ todos-reducer.test.ts‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ todos-styles.ts‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ user/‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ...‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ user-reducer.ts‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ user-reducer.test.ts‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hocs/‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ...‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ with-layout.tsx‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hooks/‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ redux/‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ root-reducer.ts‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ root-saga.ts‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ store.ts‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ...‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ middleware.tsThis example shows you how you can organize your src/ directory.

A facade is a design pattern where you provide a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.Create a file that contains all facades related to your user profile model features/user-profile/user-profile-model.ts.import { UserProfile } from '@prisma/client';import prisma from '@/lib/prisma';export async function retrieveUserProfileFromDatabaseByEmail(  email: UserProfile['email'],) {  return await","function retrieveUserProfileFromDatabaseByEmail(  email: UserProfile['email'],) {  return await prisma.userProfile.findUnique({ where: { email } });}There are two main reasons for using facades.Increase vendor resistance ‚Äî You can switch third-party providers easily. For example, you might switch from Firebase to Supabase or vice versa. Instead of updating your whole codebase to reflect the change, you only update the facade.Simplify your code ‚Äî A facade can reduce the code you need to write in your application because it reduces the API to your specific application needs. Simultaneously, it makes your code easier to understand because you can give the facade descriptive names.Then use your facade in your server component.import { retrieveUserProfileFromDatabaseByEmail } from '@/features/user-profiles/user-profiles-model';import {  Card,  CardContent,  CardHeader,  CardTitle,} from '@/components/ui/card';export default async function Dashboard() {  const user =    await","from '@/components/ui/card';export default async function Dashboard() {  const user =    await retrieveUserProfileFromDatabaseByEmail('jan@reactsquad.io');  return (    <Card className=\"max-w-md mx-auto\">      <CardHeader>        <CardTitle>User Profile</Card.Title>      </CardHeader>      <CardContent>        {user ? (          <ul>            <li>Name: {user.name}</li>            <li>Email: {user.email}</li>          </ul>        ) : (          <p>User not found.</p>        )}      </CardContent>    </Card>  );}Vercel PostgresYou can use Vercel Postgres for your production deployment. They have an easy to follow guide, which you can check out in the Vercel documentation. But here are the steps real quick for your convenience.To set up a database in your Vercel project, follow these steps:Go to the Storage tab and click the Create Database button.When the Browse Storage modal opens, choose Postgres and click Continue.For creating a new database:In the dialog box, type","modal opens, choose Postgres and click Continue.For creating a new database:In the dialog box, type sample_postgres_db (or a name you prefer) in the Store Name field. Ensure the name has only alphanumeric characters, \"_\" or \"-\", and does not exceed 32 characters.Choose a region. For lower latency, select a region close to your function region, which is US East by default.Click Create.Then you‚Äôll need to add POSTGRES_URL_NON_POOLING to the datasource in your Prisma schema.datasource db {  provider  = \"postgresql\"  // Uses connection pooling  url       = env(\"DATABASE_URL\")  // Uses direct connection, ‚ö†Ô∏è make sure to keep this to `POSTGRES_URL_NON_POOLING`  // or you'll have dangling databases from migrations  directUrl = env(\"POSTGRES_URL_NON_POOLING\")}Vercel uses connection poolers, which manage a pool of database connections that can be reused by different parts of an application, rather than establishing a new connection for each database request. The directUrl property is used to","than establishing a new connection for each database request. The directUrl property is used to ensure operations requiring direct database access, such as migrations, can bypass the connection pooler for reliable execution.You can get the environment variables for your Vercel database by pulling them from Vercel.vercel env pull .envPlaywrightYou also want to use E2E tests because E2E tests give you the most confidence that your app works as intended. E2E tests are skipped far too often, but you really should make it a habit to write them. The benefits are compounding.Initialize Playwright.$ npm init playwright@latestGetting started with writing end-to-end tests with Playwright:Initializing project in '.'‚úî Where to put your end-to-end tests? ¬∑ playwright‚úî Add a GitHub Actions workflow?

(Y/n) ¬∑ trueIf this is your first time using Playwright, you can have a look through the test-examples/","¬∑ trueIf this is your first time using Playwright, you can have a look through the test-examples/ folder that the initialization script creates, and then deleted it because you won't need it.Modify the webServer key in your playwright.config.ts file.webServer: {  command: process.env.CI ? 'npm run build && npm run start' : 'npm run dev',  port: 3000,},Add two scripts for your E2E tests to your package.json.\"test:e2e\": \"npx playwright test\",\"test:e2e:ui\": \"npx playwright test --ui\",The first one runs your Playwright test in headless mode, while the second one runs your test in UI mode, which gives you time travel debugging, watch mode and more.import { expect, test } from '@playwright/test';test.describe('landing page', () => {  test('given any user: shows the test user', async ({ page }) => {    await page.goto('/');    await expect(page.getByText('Jan Hesters')).toBeVisible();    await expect(page.getByText('jan@reactsquad.io')).toBeVisible();  });});Run your tests to check that your","expect(page.getByText('jan@reactsquad.io')).toBeVisible();  });});Run your tests to check that your Playwright setup worked.$ npm run test:e2e> reactsquad-production@0.1.0 test:e2e> npx playwright testRunning 3 tests using 3 workers  3 passed (3.9s)It ran three tests because by default Playwright is configured to run in Chrome, Safari, and Firefox.GitHub ActionsIt‚Äôs good practice to run your app with CI/CD. CI/CD stands for continuous delivery and continuous deployment.Add a secret for your database URL to your repository‚Äôs settings in GitHub.DATABASE_URL=\"postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/testdb\"Then create your GitHub Actions YAML configuration in a .github/workflows/pull-request.yml file for a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline including linting, type checking, testing, and more.name: Pull Requeston: [pull_request]jobs:  lint:    name: ‚¨£ ESLint    runs-on: ubuntu-latest    steps:      - name: ‚¨áÔ∏è Checkout repo        uses: actions/checkout@v3      - name: ‚éî Setup node","- name: ‚¨áÔ∏è Checkout repo        uses: actions/checkout@v3      - name: ‚éî Setup node        uses: actions/setup-node@v3        with:          node-version: 20      - name: üì• Download deps        uses: bahmutov/npm-install@v1      - name: üî¨ Lint        run: npm run lint  type-check:    name:  ¶ TypeScript    runs-on: ubuntu-latest    steps:      - name: ‚¨áÔ∏è Checkout repo        uses: actions/checkout@v3      - name: ‚éî Setup node        uses: actions/setup-node@v3        with:          node-version: 20      - name: üì• Download deps        uses: bahmutov/npm-install@v1      - name: üîé Type check        run: npm run type-check --if-present  commitlint:    name: ‚öôÔ∏è commitlint    runs-on: ubuntu-latest    if: github.actor != 'dependabot[bot]'    env:      GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}    steps:      - name: ‚¨áÔ∏è Checkout repo        uses: actions/checkout@v3        with:          fetch-depth: 0      - name: ‚öôÔ∏è commitlint        uses: wagoid/commitlint-github-action@v4  vitest:","0      - name: ‚öôÔ∏è commitlint        uses: wagoid/commitlint-github-action@v4  vitest:    name: ‚ö° Vitest    runs-on: ubuntu-latest    services:      postgres:        image: postgres:12        env:          POSTGRES_USER: postgres          POSTGRES_PASSWORD: postgres          POSTGRES_DB: testdb        ports:          - 5432:5432    steps:      - name: ‚¨áÔ∏è Checkout repo        uses: actions/checkout@v3      - name: ‚éî Setup node        uses: actions/setup-node@v3        with:          node-version: 20      - name: üì• Download deps        uses: bahmutov/npm-install@v1      - name: üõ† Setup Database        run: npm run prisma:wipe        env:          DATABASE_URL: postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/testdb      - name: ‚ö° Run vitest        run: npm run test -- --coverage        env:          DATABASE_URL: postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/testdb  playwright:    name: üé≠ Playwright    runs-on: ubuntu-latest    services:      postgres:        image: postgres:12        env:","runs-on: ubuntu-latest    services:      postgres:        image: postgres:12        env:          POSTGRES_USER: postgres          POSTGRES_PASSWORD: postgres          POSTGRES_DB: testdb        ports:          - 5432:5432    steps:      - name: ‚¨áÔ∏è Checkout repo        uses: actions/checkout@v3      - name: ‚éî Setup node        uses: actions/setup-node@v3        with:          node-version: 20      - name: üì• Download deps        uses: bahmutov/npm-install@v1      - name: üåê Install Playwright Browsers        run: npx playwright install --with-deps      - name: üõ† Setup Database        run: npm run prisma:wipe        env:          DATABASE_URL: postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/testdb      - name: üé≠ Playwright Run        run: npx playwright test        env:          DATABASE_URL: postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/testdb      - name: üì∏ Playwright Screenshots        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4        if: failure()        with:          name: playwright-report","uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4        if: failure()        with:          name: playwright-report          path: playwright-report/          retention-days: 30Now every time you make a pull request to your app, it automatically runs your tests to ensure it works, runs TypeScript type checks and lints it, so that everyone contributes code with the same formatting.NextjsJavaScriptNextjs 15Tutorial----18FollowWritten by Jan Hesters1K Followers¬∑10 FollowingSubscribe on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/@JanHesters Follow on X: https://x.com/janhesters Ask better questions.FollowResponses (18)See all responsesHelpStatusAboutCareersPressBlogPrivacyRulesTermsText to speech"],"metadata":[{"description":"I‚Äôve worked on Next.js applications that scaled to over 100k monthly active users and landing pages with millions of monthly visitors.

In this article, I'll share all the lessons I've learned through countless iterations.Whether you're part of a small team of one, two, or three developers, or you work on a massive Next.js project with multiple teams on the same codebase, it's critical to get the foundation of your app right from the start. Even if you're working on an existing project, you will discover some hard-earned insights that you can apply to your app today.Let me take you by the hand and show you all the steps and packages that you want to set up and explain to you why they're useful, so your app scales","and packages that you want to set up and explain to you why they're useful, so your app scales smoothly.Initialize Your ProjectBegin by creating a new Next.js project.npx create-next-app@latest","It may ask you if it can install the latest create-next-app version, just hit yes.Need to install the following packages:\ncreate-next-app@15.0.0\nOk to proceed? (y)\nAnd then configure your project by hitting yes on everything (TypeScript, Tailwind, app router).‚úî **What is your project named?** ‚Ä¶ reactsquad-production\n‚úî **Would you like to use** **TypeScript****?** ‚Ä¶ No / Yes\nYes\n‚úî **Would you like to use** **ESLint****?** ‚Ä¶ No / Yes\nYes\n‚úî **Would you like to use** **Tailwind CSS****?** ‚Ä¶ No / Yes\nYes\n‚úî **Would you like to use** **`src/` directory****?** ‚Ä¶ No / Yes\nYes\n‚úî **Would you like to use** **App Router****? (recommended)** ‚Ä¶ No / Yes\nYes\n‚úî **Would you like to customize the default** **import alias** **(@/*)?** ‚Ä¶ No / No\nThen change into the directory of your project and open it in your favorite editor.$ cd nextjs-for-production\n~/dev/nextjs-for-production (main) ü§Ø\n$ cursor .","~/dev/nextjs-for-production (main) ü§Ø\n$ cursor .\nRun The Development ServerYou want to verify that your setup worked.Run npm run dev to start the development server.Visit http://localhost:3000 to view your application.Type Checks With TypeScriptYour project has TypeScript already configured, but you also want to add an explicit command to your package.json that checks all your files for type errors.\"type-check\": \"tsc -b\"","You're going to use this command later together with other automated static analysis checks.Code FormattingWhen you collaborate with a large team on a project, it's important to unify the way that everyone writes code. Discuss choices like using semicolons, quote styles, and tabs versus spaces with your team.Then use tools to enforce your style guide and format code automatically.There are two tools for that: Prettier and ESLint.PrettierPrettier is an opinionated code formatter that eliminates style discussions during code reviews.Install Prettier together with its Tailwind plugin.npm install --save-dev prettier prettier-plugin-tailwindcss\nCreate a prettier.config.js file with your preferred rules.module.exports = {\n  arrowParens: 'avoid',\n  bracketSameLine: false,\n  bracketSpacing: true,\n  htmlWhitespaceSensitivity: 'css',\n  insertPragma: false,\n  jsxSingleQuote: false,\n  plugins: ['prettier-plugin-tailwindcss'],\n  printWidth: 80,\n  proseWrap: 'always',\n  quoteProps: 'as-needed',","printWidth: 80,\n  proseWrap: 'always',\n  quoteProps: 'as-needed',\n  requirePragma: false,\n  semi: true,\n  singleQuote: true,\n  tabWidth: 2,\n  trailingComma: 'all',\n  useTabs: false,\n};\nAdd a formatting script to your package.json.\"format\": \"prettier --write .\",\nRun the formatter to apply your style.$ npm run format","> nextjs-for-production@0.1.0 format\n> prettier --write .","next.config.mjs 4ms (unchanged)\npackage-lock.json 54ms (unchanged)\npackage.json 1ms (unchanged)\npostcss.config.mjs 2ms (unchanged)\nREADME.md 20ms (unchanged)\nsrc/app/globals.css 17ms (unchanged)\nsrc/app/layout.tsx 30ms (unchanged)\nsrc/app/page.tsx 11ms (unchanged)\ntailwind.config.ts 2ms (unchanged)\ntsconfig.json 2ms (unchanged)\nYour files are now \"prettier\", but you also want to use ESLint.ESLintESLint can scan your code for both stylistic and logical issues. Install ESLint and its plugins, like unicorn, playwright and import sort.npm install --save-dev @typescript-eslint/parser eslint-plugin-unicorn eslint-plugin-import eslint-plugin-playwright eslint-config-prettier eslint-plugin-prettier eslint-plugin-simple-import-sort\nUpdate your .eslintrc.json.{\n  \"extends\": [\n    \"next/core-web-vitals\",\n    \"plugin:unicorn/recommended\",\n    \"plugin:import/recommended\",\n    \"plugin:playwright/recommended\",\n    \"plugin:prettier/recommended\"\n  ],\n  \"plugins\": [\"simple-import-sort\"],\n  \"rules\": {","\"plugin:prettier/recommended\"\n  ],\n  \"plugins\": [\"simple-import-sort\"],\n  \"rules\": {\n    \"simple-import-sort/exports\": \"error\",\n    \"simple-import-sort/imports\": \"error\",\n    \"unicorn/no-array-callback-reference\": \"off\",\n    \"unicorn/no-array-for-each\": \"off\",\n    \"unicorn/no-array-reduce\": \"off\",\n    \"unicorn/prevent-abbreviations\": [\n      \"error\",\n      {\n        \"allowList\": {\n          \"e2e\": true\n        },\n        \"replacements\": {\n          \"props\": false,\n          \"ref\": false,\n          \"params\": false\n        }\n      }\n    ]\n  },\n  \"overrides\": [\n    {\n      \"files\": [\"*.js\"],\n      \"rules\": {\n        \"unicorn/prefer-module\": \"off\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}","\"rules\": {\n        \"unicorn/prefer-module\": \"off\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\nThis tutorial's plugins offer different functions. For detailed descriptions, visit their respective GitHub pages.But in short, they enforce coding standards, organize imports, and ensure correct use of modern JavaScript features. Since ESLint and Prettier can conflict, this setup makes them work together smoothly. The plugins also help prevent bugs and keep styles consistent, especially with tools like Vitest and Playwright.Add a linting script to your package.json.\"lint:fix\": \"next lint --fix\",\nRun it to format all files according to your new rules.$ npm run lint:fix","> nextjs-for-production@0.1.0 lint:fix\n> next lint --fix","‚úî No ESLint warnings or errors\nIf you get a TypeScript version warning, you can ignore that.Note: As of this article's writing, ESLint 9 is available, but this tutorial uses ESLint 8 because many plugins do not yet support the latest version.CommitlintWhen collaborating with a large team, it's also helpful to enforce consistent commit messages to keep the project history clear. By choosing the right standards, you can automate changelog and release generation with correct semantic versioning.Install Commitlint and its necessary configurations. This includes Husky, which helps manage Git hooks.npm install --save-dev @commitlint/cli@latest @commitlint/config-conventional@latest husky@latest\nInitialize Husky in your project to set up the basic configuration.npx husky-init && npm install\nAdd hooks to automate linting and type checking before each commit, and customize your commit message workflow.npx husky add .husky/pre-commit 'npm run lint && npm run type-check'","npx husky add .husky/prepare-commit-msg 'exec < /dev/tty && npx cz --hook || true'\nThe pre-commit hook runs after git commit, but before the commit message is finalized and runs linting and type-checking on your code.The prepare-commit-msg hook runs after git commit is initiated but before the commit message editor opens. It runs commitizen CLI to let you craft conventional commit messages. You'll learn how to use this hook in a bit.Remove the line that says npm test from .husky/_/pre-commit.Make sure these scripts are executable.chmod a+x .husky/pre-commit\nchmod a+x .husky/prepare-commit-msg\nHere, chmod stands for \"change mode.\" This command allows you to change the access permissions or modes of a file or directory in Unix and Unix-like operating systems. The argument a+x adds execute permissions for all users.Install Commitizen, which provides a CLI for crafting conventional commit messages.npm install --save-dev commitizen cz-conventional-changelog","Configure Commitizen in your package.json to use the conventional changelog standard.\"config\": {\n  \"commitizen\": {\n    \"path\": \"cz-conventional-changelog\"\n  }\n},\nThe conventional changeloge standard is a specification for adding human and machine-readable meaning to commit messages. It is designed to automate the producing of changelogs and releases based on the Git history of your project.A future article will explain this standard in detail. It's included in this tutorial because getting it right from the start is important. You can use it and benefit from it without needing an in-depth understanding.Create your commitlint.config.cjs file with rules that suit your team's needs.

It has the following benefits:Scalability: Large applications are easier to scale and maintain because each feature acts like a mini-application. You avoid scrolling up and down in your file list to find all the files you need.Collaboration: Developers can focus on specific features without disrupting others‚Äô work.Onboarding: New developers understand the project structure faster, as all files for a feature are in one place.Refactoring: Updating a feature is streamlined since all its elements are grouped together.Modularity: Features can be reused, shared, or turned into standalone packages more easily.Micro-frontends: If your application ever grows to 30 or more engineers, it is easy to refactor to micro-frontends.Here is a more concrete example.src/","‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app/\n‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ...\n‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ (group)/\n‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ about/\n‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ page.tsx\n‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ settings/\n‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ page.tsx\n‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ layout.tsx\n‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dashboard/\n‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ page.tsx\n‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ layout.tsx\n‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ layout.tsx\n‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ page.tsx\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/\n‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ...\n‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ header/\n‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ header-component.tsx\n‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ header-component.test.ts\n‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ header.module.css\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ features/\n‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ...\n‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ todos/\n‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ...\n‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ todos-component.tsx\n‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ todos-component.test.ts\n‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ todos-container.ts\n‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ todos-reducer.ts\n‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ todos-reducer.test.ts\n‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ todos-styles.ts\n‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ user/\n‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ...\n‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ user-reducer.ts\n‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ user-reducer.test.ts\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hocs/\n‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ...\n‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ with-layout.tsx\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hooks/\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ redux/\n‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ root-reducer.ts\n‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ root-saga.ts\n‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ store.ts\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ...\n‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ middleware.ts","‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ redux/\n‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ root-reducer.ts\n‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ root-saga.ts\n‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ store.ts\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ...\n‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ middleware.ts\nThis example shows you how you can organize your src/ directory. Generally, everything is grouped by feature. Tests files live next to their respective implementation files. But anything that is shared by multiple features is then grouped in general folders, such as components/ or HOCs/ or hooks/. Shared setup for state management - in this example for Redux - lives in a redux/ folder.Some people also like to group by feature within the app/ folder. Here is how that would look like.src/\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app/\n‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ...\n‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ (group)/\n‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dashboard/\n‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/\n‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dashboard-header.tsx\n‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dashboard-header.test.ts\n‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dashboard-widgets.tsx\n‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ dashboard-widgets.test.ts\n‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ services/\n‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ fetch-data.ts\n‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ fetch-data.test.ts\n‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ auth-service.ts\n‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ auth-service.test.ts","‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ auth-service.ts\n‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ auth-service.test.ts\n‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ page.tsx\n‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ layout.ts\n‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ layout.tsx\n‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ page.tsx\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ...\n‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ middleware.ts\nIn this tutorial, you're going to group files by feature in the first way.VitestIf you want to avoid bugs and prevent regressions, you need to write tests. Vitest is a great choice because it has the same API as the most popular framework, which is Jest, but it runs faster.Install Vitest.npm install -D vitest\nAnd configure a testing command in your package.json.\"test\": \"vitest --reporter=verbose\",\nThen create an example.test.ts file and write a short test to check to check Vitest works.import { describe, expect, test } from 'vitest';","describe('example', () => {\n  test('given a passing test: passes', () => {\n    expect(1).toStrictEqual(1);\n  });\n});\nIt should pass.$ npm test\n\n> nextjs-for-production@0.1.0 test\n> vitest --reporter=verbose\n\n\n DEV  v2.0.5 /Users/jan/dev/nextjs-for-production\n\n ‚úì src/example.test.ts (1)\n   ‚úì example (1)\n     ‚úì given a passing test: passes\n\n Test Files  1 passed (1)\n      Tests  1 passed (1)\n   Start at  14:06:24\n   Duration  203ms (transform 20ms, setup 0ms, collect 17ms, tests 1ms, environment 0ms, prepare 56ms)","PASS  Waiting for file changes...\n       press h to show help, press q to quit\nIf you want to learn how you can write better tests, check out this article that teaches you 12 evergreen testing principles that every senior developer should know.React Testing LibraryYou also want to write tests for your React components. For that, you can use the React Testing Library, often abbreviated as RTL.npm install --save-dev @testing-library/react @testing-library/dom @testing-library/jest-dom @testing-library/user-event @types/react @types/react-dom happy-dom @vitejs/plugin-react vite-tsconfig-paths\nThen, create a vitest.config.ts file.import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react';\nimport tsconfigPaths from 'vite-tsconfig-paths';\nimport { defineConfig } from 'vitest/config';","export default defineConfig({\n  plugins: [react(), tsconfigPaths()],\n  server: {\n    port: 3000,\n  },\n  test: {\n    environment: 'happy-dom',\n    globals: true,\n    setupFiles: ['./src/tests/setup-test-environment.ts'],\n    include: ['./src/**/*.{spec,test}.{js,mjs,cjs,ts,mts,cts,jsx,tsx}'],\n    watch: {\n      ignored: [\n        String.raw`.*\\\\/node_modules\\\\/.*`,\n        String.raw`.*\\\\/build\\\\/.*`,\n        String.raw`.*\\\\/postgres-data\\\\/.*`,\n      ],\n    },\n    coverage: {\n      reporter: ['text', 'json', 'html'],\n    },\n  },\n});\nIt sets up the development server, specifies testing parameters like that the ¬†environment is happy-dom and file paths, and defines coverage report formats.And create a file called src/tests/setup-test-environment.ts to set up your test environment.import '@testing-library/jest-dom/vitest';\n\n// See <https://reactjs.org/blog/2022/03/08/react-18-upgrade-guide.html#configuring-your-testing-environment>.","// @ts-ignore\nglobalThis.IS_REACT_ACT_ENVIRONMENT = true;\nThe first line imports additional assertions, which extend Vitest's built-in assertions, allowing you to more easily test DOM nodes. For example, you can check if an element is visible, has a certain text content, or includes specific attributes.The global environment flag ensures that tests involving state updates work as expected without timing issues.Next, you want to set up a custom render method src/tests/react-test-utils.tsx./* eslint-disable import/export */\nimport type { RenderOptions } from '@testing-library/react';\nimport { render } from '@testing-library/react';\nimport type { ReactElement } from 'react';\n\nconst customRender = (\n  ui: ReactElement,\n  options?: Omit<RenderOptions, 'queries'>,\n) =>\n  render(ui, {\n    wrapper: ({ children }) => <>{children}</>,\n    ...options,\n  });\n\n// re-export everything\nexport * from '@testing-library/react';","// re-export everything\nexport * from '@testing-library/react';\n\n// override render method\nexport { customRender as render };\nexport { default as userEvent } from '@testing-library/user-event';\nYou can use this to wrap your code in providers, for example, when using Redux, or adding layouts and styling.Make sure your configuration worked by writing a test for a React component.import { describe, expect, test } from 'vitest';\n\nimport { render, screen } from '@/tests/react-test-utils';\n\nfunction MyReactComponent() {\n  return <div>My React Component</div>;\n}\n\ndescribe('MyReactComponent', () => {\n  test('given no props: renders a text', () => {\n    render(<MyReactComponent />);","expect(screen.getByText('My React Component')).toBeInTheDocument();\n  });\n});\nYou import render and screen from your test utils file instead of from RTL directly.toBeInTheDocument() is one of those special assertions that you configured earlier in your test environment setup file.It should pass, too. ‚úì src/features/example.test.tsx (1)\n   ‚úì MyReactComponent (1)\n     ‚úì given no props: renders a text\n\n Test Files  1 passed (1)\n      Tests  1 passed (1)\n   Start at  09:33:32\n   Duration  402ms (transform 24ms, setup 55ms, collect 87ms, tests 9ms, environment 80ms, prepare 45ms)","PASS  Waiting for file changes...\n       press h to show help, press q to quit\nStylingNow let's talk about styling.

The negotiator package helps your app to figure out what type of content (like language or format) your user's browser can handle best, based on the information the browser sends.You'll also need to install the TypeScript types for the negotiator package.npm install --save-dev @types/negotiator\nThen, create your i18n config in a new file at src/features/internationalization/i18n-config.ts.export const i18n = {\n  defaultLocale: 'en-US',\n  locales: ['en-US'],\n} as const;","export type Locale = (typeof i18n)['locales'][number];\nUse that i18n config, in your localization-middleware at src/features/internationalization/localization-middleware.ts.import { match } from '@formatjs/intl-localematcher';\nimport Negotiator from 'negotiator';\nimport { type NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server';\n\nimport { i18n } from './i18n-config';\n\nfunction getLocale(request: NextRequest) {\n  const headers = {\n    'accept-language': request.headers.get('accept-language') ??

You can use it to seed your database with data for development.import { exit } from 'node:process';","import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client';\nimport dotenv from 'dotenv';\n\ndotenv.config({ path: '.env.local' });\n\nconst prisma = new PrismaClient();\n\nconst prettyPrint = (object: any) =>\n  console.log(JSON.stringify(object, undefined, 2));\n\nasync function seed() {\n  const user = await prisma.userProfile.create({\n    data: {\n      email: 'jan@reactsquad.io',\n      name: 'Jan Hesters',\n      acceptedTermsAndConditions: true,\n    },\n  });\n\n  console.log('========= üå± result of seed: =========');\n  prettyPrint({ user });\n}\n\nseed()\n  .then(async () => {\n    await prisma.$disconnect();\n  })\n  // eslint-disable-next-line unicorn/prefer-top-level-await\n  .catch(async error => {\n    console.error(error);\n    await prisma.$disconnect();\n    exit(1);\n  });\nIf you run it, it'll create your user.$ npm run prisma:seed\n\n> reactsquad-production@0.1.0 prisma:seed\n> tsx ./prisma/seed.ts","> reactsquad-production@0.1.0 prisma:seed\n> tsx ./prisma/seed.ts\n\n========= üå± result of seed: =========\n{\n  \"user\": {\n    \"id\": \"clzekb5sp0000ock9gsp72p33\",\n    \"createdAt\": \"2024-08-03T20:04:27.289Z\",\n    \"updatedAt\": \"2024-08-03T20:04:27.289Z\",\n    \"email\": \"jan@reactsquad.io\",\n    \"name\": \"Jan Hesters\",\n    \"acceptedTermsAndConditions\": true\n  }\n}\nIn your server components, you can use prisma to fetch any data.import prisma from '@/lib/prisma';\nimport {\n  Card,\n  CardContent,\n  CardHeader,\n  CardTitle,\n} from '@/components/ui/card';\n\nexport default async function Dashboard() {\n  const user = await prisma.userProfile.findUnique({\n    where: { email: 'jan@reactsquad.io' },\n  });","return (\n    <Card className=\"max-w-md mx-auto\">\n      <CardHeader>\n        <CardTitle>User Profile</Card.Title>\n      </CardHeader>\n      <CardContent>\n        {user ? (\n          <ul>\n            <li>Name: {user.name}</li>\n            <li>Email: {user.email}</li>\n          </ul>\n        ) : (\n          <p>User not found.</p>\n        )}\n      </CardContent>\n    </Card>\n  );\n}\nUse FacadesIt's a good idea to abstract away your database calls using facades. A facade is a design pattern where you provide a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.Create a file that contains all facades related to your user profile model features/user-profile/user-profile-model.ts.import { UserProfile } from '@prisma/client';\n\nimport prisma from '@/lib/prisma';","import prisma from '@/lib/prisma';\n\nexport async function retrieveUserProfileFromDatabaseByEmail(\n  email: UserProfile['email'],\n) {\n  return await prisma.userProfile.findUnique({ where: { email } });\n}\nThere are two main reasons for using facades.Increase vendor resistance - You can switch third-party providers easily. For example, you might switch from Firebase to Supabase or vice versa. Instead of updating your whole codebase to reflect the change, you only update the facade.Simplify your code - A facade can reduce the code you need to write in your application because it reduces the API to your specific application needs. Simultaneously, it makes your code easier to understand because you can give the facade descriptive names.Then use your facade in your server component.import { retrieveUserProfileFromDatabaseByEmail } from '@/features/user-profiles/user-profiles-model';\nimport {\n  Card,\n  CardContent,\n  CardHeader,\n  CardTitle,\n} from '@/components/ui/card';","export default async function Dashboard() {\n  const user =\n    await retrieveUserProfileFromDatabaseByEmail('jan@reactsquad.io');\n\n  return (\n    <Card className=\"max-w-md mx-auto\">\n      <CardHeader>\n        <CardTitle>User Profile</Card.Title>\n      </CardHeader>","<CardContent>\n        {user ? (\n          <ul>\n            <li>Name: {user.name}</li>\n            <li>Email: {user.email}</li>\n          </ul>\n        ) : (\n          <p>User not found.</p>\n        )}\n      </CardContent>\n    </Card>\n  );\n}",") : (\n          <p>User not found.</p>\n        )}\n      </CardContent>\n    </Card>\n  );\n}\nVercel PostgresYou can use Vercel Postgres for your production deployment. They have an easy to follow guide, which you can check out in the Vercel documentation. But here are the steps real quick for your convenience.To set up a database in your Vercel project, follow these steps:Go to the Storage tab and click the Create Database button.When the Browse Storage modal opens, choose Postgres and click Continue.For creating a new database:In the dialog box, type sample_postgres_db (or a name you prefer) in the Store Name field. Ensure the name has only alphanumeric characters, \"_\" or \"-\", and does not exceed 32 characters.Choose a region. For lower latency, select a region close to your function region, which is US East by default.Click Create.Then you'll need to add POSTGRES_URL_NON_POOLING to the datasource in your Prisma schema.datasource db {\n  provider  = \"postgresql\"","provider  = \"postgresql\"\n  // Uses connection pooling\n  url       = env(\"DATABASE_URL\")\n  // Uses direct connection, ‚ö†Ô∏è make sure to keep this to `POSTGRES_URL_NON_POOLING`\n  // or you'll have dangling databases from migrations\n  directUrl = env(\"POSTGRES_URL_NON_POOLING\")\n}\nVercel uses connection poolers, which manage a pool of database connections that can be reused by different parts of an application, rather than establishing a new connection for each database request. The directUrl property is used to ensure operations requiring direct database access, such as migrations, can bypass the connection pooler for reliable execution.You can get the environment variables for your Vercel database by pulling them from Vercel.vercel env pull .env","PlaywrightYou also want to use E2E tests because E2E tests give you the most confidence that your app works as intended. E2E tests are skipped far too often, but you really should make it a habit to write them. The benefits are compounding.Initialize Playwright.$ npm init playwright@latest\nGetting started with writing end-to-end tests with Playwright:\nInitializing project in '.'\n‚úî Where to put your end-to-end tests? ¬∑ playwright\n‚úî Add a GitHub Actions workflow? (y/N) ¬∑ false\n‚úî Install Playwright browsers (can be done manually via 'npx playwright install')? (Y/n) ¬∑ true\nIf this is your first time using Playwright, you can have a look through the test-examples/ folder that the initialization script creates, and then deleted it because you won't need it.Modify the webServer key in your playwright.config.ts file.webServer: {\n  command: process.env.CI ? 'npm run build && npm run start' : 'npm run dev',\n  port: 3000,\n},","command: process.env.CI ? 'npm run build && npm run start' : 'npm run dev',\n  port: 3000,\n},\nAdd two scripts for your E2E tests to your package.json.\"test:e2e\": \"npx playwright test\",\n\"test:e2e:ui\": \"npx playwright test --ui\",\nThe first one runs your Playwright test in headless mode, while the second one runs your test in UI mode, which gives you time travel debugging, watch mode and more.import { expect, test } from '@playwright/test';","test.describe('landing page', () => {\n  test('given any user: shows the test user', async ({ page }) => {\n    await page.goto('/');\n\n    await expect(page.getByText('Jan Hesters')).toBeVisible();\n    await expect(page.getByText('jan@reactsquad.io')).toBeVisible();\n  });\n});\nRun your tests to check that your Playwright setup worked.$ npm run test:e2e\n\n> reactsquad-production@0.1.0 test:e2e\n> npx playwright test","> reactsquad-production@0.1.0 test:e2e\n> npx playwright test\n\n\nRunning 3 tests using 3 workers\n  3 passed (3.9s)\nt ran three tests because by default Playwright is configured to run in Chrome, Safari, and Firefox.GitHub ActionsIt's good practice to run your app with CI/CD. CI/CD stands for continuous delivery and continuous deployment.Add a secret for your database URL to your repository's settings in GitHub.DATABASE_URL=\"postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/testdb\"\nThen create your GitHub Actions YAML configuration in a .github/workflows/pull-request.yml file for a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline including linting, type checking, testing, and more.name: Pull Request\n\non: [pull_request]\n\njobs:\n  lint:\n    name: ‚¨£ ESLint\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - name: ‚¨áÔ∏è Checkout repo\n        uses: actions/checkout@v3\n\n      - name: ‚éî Setup node\n        uses: actions/setup-node@v3\n        with:\n          node-version: 20","- name: üì• Download deps\n        uses: bahmutov/npm-install@v1\n\n      - name: üî¨ Lint\n        run: npm run lint\n\n  type-check:\n    name:  ¶ TypeScript\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - name: ‚¨áÔ∏è Checkout repo\n        uses: actions/checkout@v3\n\n      - name: ‚éî Setup node\n        uses: actions/setup-node@v3\n        with:\n          node-version: 20\n\n      - name: üì• Download deps\n        uses: bahmutov/npm-install@v1\n\n      - name: üîé Type check\n        run: npm run type-check --if-present\n\n  commitlint:\n    name: ‚öôÔ∏è commitlint\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    if: github.actor != 'dependabot[bot]'\n    env:\n      GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n    steps:\n      - name: ‚¨áÔ∏è Checkout repo\n        uses: actions/checkout@v3\n        with:\n          fetch-depth: 0\n      - name: ‚öôÔ∏è commitlint\n        uses: wagoid/commitlint-github-action@v4","vitest:\n    name: ‚ö° Vitest\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    services:\n      postgres:\n        image: postgres:12\n        env:\n          POSTGRES_USER: postgres\n          POSTGRES_PASSWORD: postgres\n          POSTGRES_DB: testdb\n        ports:\n          - 5432:5432\n    steps:\n      - name: ‚¨áÔ∏è Checkout repo\n        uses: actions/checkout@v3\n\n      - name: ‚éî Setup node\n        uses: actions/setup-node@v3\n        with:\n          node-version: 20\n\n      - name: üì• Download deps\n        uses: bahmutov/npm-install@v1\n\n      - name: üõ† Setup Database\n        run: npm run prisma:wipe\n        env:\n          DATABASE_URL: postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/testdb\n\n      - name: ‚ö° Run vitest\n        run: npm run test -- --coverage\n        env:\n          DATABASE_URL: postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/testdb","playwright:\n    name: üé≠ Playwright\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    services:\n      postgres:\n        image: postgres:12\n        env:\n          POSTGRES_USER: postgres\n          POSTGRES_PASSWORD: postgres\n          POSTGRES_DB: testdb\n        ports:\n          - 5432:5432\n    steps:\n      - name: ‚¨áÔ∏è Checkout repo\n        uses: actions/checkout@v3\n\n      - name: ‚éî Setup node\n        uses: actions/setup-node@v3\n        with:\n          node-version: 20\n\n      - name: üì• Download deps\n        uses: bahmutov/npm-install@v1\n\n      - name: üåê Install Playwright Browsers\n        run: npx playwright install --with-deps\n\n      - name: üõ† Setup Database\n        run: npm run prisma:wipe\n        env:\n          DATABASE_URL: postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/testdb\n\n      - name: üé≠ Playwright Run\n        run: npx playwright test\n        env:\n          DATABASE_URL: postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/testdb","- name: üì∏ Playwright Screenshots\n        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4\n        if: failure()\n        with:\n          name: playwright-report\n          path: playwright-report/\n          retention-days: 30\n‚ÄçNow every time you make a pull request to your app, it automatically runs your tests to ensure it works, runs TypeScript type checks and lints it, so that everyone contributes code with the same formatting.‚ÄçInterested in hiring skilled Next.js developers for your startup?

requirements","Before you begin, make sure your system meets the following requirements:\n\nNode.js 18.18 or later.\nmacOS, Windows (including WSL), or Linux.\n\nAutomatic installation","Node.js 18.18 or later.\nmacOS, Windows (including WSL), or Linux.\n\nAutomatic installation\n\n\n\n\n\nThe quickest way to create a new Next.js app is using create-next-app, which sets up everything automatically for you. To create a project, run:\nTerminalnpx create-next-app@latest\nOn installation, you'll see the following prompts:\nTerminalWhat is your project named? my-app\nWould you like to use TypeScript? No / Yes\nWould you like to use ESLint? No / Yes\nWould you like to use Tailwind CSS? No / Yes\nWould you like your code inside a `src/` directory? No / Yes\nWould you like to use App Router? (recommended) No / Yes\nWould you like to use Turbopack for `next dev`?  No / Yes\nWould you like to customize the import alias (`@/*` by default)? No / Yes\nWhat import alias would you like configured? @/*\nAfter the prompts, create-next-app will create a folder with your project name and install the required dependencies.\nManual installation","To manually create a new Next.js app, install the required packages:\nTerminalnpm install next@latest react@latest react-dom@latest\nThen, add the following scripts to your package.json file:\npackage.json{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"dev\": \"next dev\",\n    \"build\": \"next build\",\n    \"start\": \"next start\",\n    \"lint\": \"next lint\"\n  }\n}\nThese scripts refer to the different stages of developing an application:\n\nnext dev: Starts the development server.\nnext build: Builds the application for production.\nnext start: Starts the production server.\nnext lint: Runs ESLint.\n\nCreate the app directory","Create the app directory\n\n\n\n\nNext.js uses file-system routing, which means the routes in your application are determined by how you structure your files.Create an app folder. Then, inside app, create a layout.tsx file. This file is the root layout. It's required and must contain the <html> and <body> tags.app/layout.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptexport default function RootLayout({\n  children,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n}) {\n  return (\n    <html lang=\"en\">\n      <body>{children}</body>\n    </html>\n  )\n}Create a home page app/page.tsx with some initial content:app/page.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptexport default function Page() {\n  return <h1>Hello, Next.js!</h1>\n}Both layout.tsx and page.tsx will be rendered when the user visits the root of your application (/).\nGood to know:","If you forget to create the root layout, Next.js will automatically create this file when running the development server with next dev.\nYou can optionally use a src folder in the root of your project to separate your application's code from configuration files.\n\n\n\nCreate the public folder (optional)\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a public folder at the root of your project to store static assets such as images, fonts, etc. Files inside public can then be referenced by your code starting from the base URL (/).\nYou can then reference these assets using the root path (/).

To add TypeScript to your project, rename a file to .ts / .tsx and run next dev. Next.js will automatically install the necessary dependencies and add a tsconfig.json file with the recommended config options.\nIDE Plugin\n\n\n\n\nNext.js includes a custom TypeScript plugin and type checker, which VSCode and other code editors can use for advanced type-checking and auto-completion.You can enable the plugin in VS Code by:\nOpening the command palette (Ctrl/‚åò + Shift + P)\nSearching for \"TypeScript: Select TypeScript Version\"\nSelecting \"Use Workspace Version\"\n\nSee the TypeScript reference page for more information.\nSet up ESLint","See the TypeScript reference page for more information.\nSet up ESLint\n\n\n\n\n\nNext.js comes with built-in ESLint. It automatically installs the necessary packages and configures the proper settings when you create a new project with create-next-app.\nTo manually add ESLint to an existing project, add next lint as a script to package.json:\npackage.json{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"lint\": \"next lint\"\n  }\n}\nThen, run npm run lint and you will be guided through the installation and configuration process.\nTerminalnpm run lint\nYou'll see a prompt like this:\n\n? How would you like to configure ESLint?\n‚ùØ Strict (recommended)\nBase\nCancel\n\n\nStrict: Includes Next.js' base ESLint configuration along with a stricter Core Web Vitals rule-set. This is the recommended configuration for developers setting up ESLint for the first time.\nBase: Includes Next.js' base ESLint configuration.\nCancel: Skip configuration. Select this option if you plan on setting up your own custom ESLint configuration.","If Strict or Base are selected, Next.js will automatically install eslint and eslint-config-next as dependencies in your application and create an .eslintrc.json file in the root of your project that includes your selected configuration.\nYou can now run next lint every time you want to run ESLint to catch errors. Once ESLint has been set up, it will also automatically run during every build (next build). Errors will fail the build, while warnings will not.\nSee the ESLint Plugin page for more information.\nSet up Absolute Imports and Module Path Aliases","Next.js has in-built support for the \"paths\" and \"baseUrl\" options of tsconfig.json and jsconfig.json files.\nThese options allow you to alias project directories to absolute paths, making it easier and cleaner to import modules. For example:\n// Before\nimport { Button } from '../../../components/button'\n \n// After\nimport { Button } from '@/components/button'\nTo configure absolute imports, add the baseUrl configuration option to your tsconfig.json or jsconfig.json file. For example:\ntsconfig.json or jsconfig.json{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"baseUrl\": \"src/\"\n  }\n}\nIn addition to configuring the baseUrl path, you can use the \"paths\" option to \"alias\" module paths.\nFor example, the following configuration maps @/components/* to components/*:\ntsconfig.json or jsconfig.json{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"baseUrl\": \"src/\",\n    \"paths\": {\n      \"@/styles/*\": [\"styles/*\"],\n      \"@/components/*\": [\"components/*\"]\n    }\n  }\n}","\"@/styles/*\": [\"styles/*\"],\n      \"@/components/*\": [\"components/*\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\nEach of the \"paths\" are relative to the baseUrl location.PreviousGetting StartedNextProject StructureWas this helpful?","supported.Send\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResourcesDocsSupport

One way we can achieve this gem is by using quality web-building tools like NextJS- to enhance web performance such as lazy-image loading, Typescript- to keep code quality and avoid future spills and ChakraUI- to build accessibly user-friend interfaces. \nThis article will be working us through how we can combine these ‚Äúpowers‚Äù to build a ‚Äúsuperpowered‚Äù web application\nStep One- Initiate NextJS with Typescript: (Docs)\nIn our terminal, navigate to a directory to create a new project. Using your preferred package manager, let‚Äôs create a React project powered with NextJS and Typescript using this command: \nyarn create next-app --typescript or npx create-next-app@latest --ts. \nIn the process of running this command, the terminal will pop up a dialog asking us to name our new project. Let‚Äôs call it doggies (A Dog-interest website) and we are golden!","PS: The --ts or --typescript is a flag to tell the package manager to initiate a React project with Typescript.","Step Two- Install ChakraUI: (Docs)\nAfter successfully creating our project that is powered with NextJS and Typescript, let‚Äôs now install ChakraUI. Before running the command to install ChakraUI, navigate to the root of the project, then go ahead to install ChakraUI using this command: \nyarn add @chakra-ui/react @emotion/react@^11 @emotion/styled@^11 framer-motion@^6\nor\nnpm i @chakra-ui/react @emotion/react@^11 @emotion/styled@^11 framer-motion@^6 \nAnd that‚Äôs it! ChakraUI is now available on our project. To have full access to the goodies that comes with ChakraUI we need to do one last thing and that takes us to step number 3.\n\n\nStep Three- Activate the power of ChakraUI.\nTo do this, we need to access the _app.tsx file inside our Pages folder of our project and wrap its return components in a ChakraProvider Component. \nThis is what the file looks like by default:\n\n\nimport type { AppProps } from 'next/app'","import type { AppProps } from 'next/app'\n\nfunction MyApp({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) {\n  return <Component {...pageProps} />\n}\n\nexport default MyApp\n\n\n\nEnter fullscreen mode\n\n\nExit fullscreen mode\n\n\n\n\n\nSo now let‚Äôs import ChakraProvider and use it as a wrapper before returning the Components. Our file should now look like this:\n\n\nimport '../styles/globals.css'\nimport type { AppProps } from 'next/app'\nimport { ChakraProvider } from '@chakra-ui/react'\n\nfunction MyApp({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) {\n  return (\n    <ChakraProvider>\n      <Component {...pageProps} />\n    </ChakraProvider>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default MyApp;\n\n\n\nEnter fullscreen mode\n\n\nExit fullscreen mode","export default MyApp;\n\n\n\nEnter fullscreen mode\n\n\nExit fullscreen mode\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd there it is! Our application is now powered with NextJS, Typescript and ChakraUI. \nTo see the smooth user interfaces your can create with ChakraUI you can check the documentation of all its components here. \nI‚Äôll be writing an article about why this setup is my favourite and what opportunities this gives us, until then, have a good day and stay well!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Top comments (1)\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonal\nTrusted User\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Create template\n      \nTemplates let you quickly answer FAQs or store snippets for re-use.\n\n\n\nSubmit\nPreview\nDismiss\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCollapse\n\n\nExpand\n\n\n\n\n\n\n¬†\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInfo\n\n\n\n      Comment hidden by post author - thread only accessible via permalink\n  \n\n\nDustinSeals\n\n\n\n      DustinSeals\n      \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      DustinSeals\n      \n    \n\n\n\nFollow","DustinSeals\n\n\n\n      DustinSeals\n      \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      DustinSeals\n      \n    \n\n\n\nFollow\n\n\n    I am Dustin .

For example if the user sets their computer to dark mode by default, Chakra-UI will default to dark mode.\nComposibility: Components can be created from the Chakra-UI ones or if needed custom components can be created with ease.\nTypescript Support: Chakra-UI is written in TypeScript and provides class types for easy integration.\n\n\n\n\n\n  What we will be making\n\nIn this tutorial we will use Chakra-UI to create a simple user list/profile page. \nWe will also integrate a toggler to toggle between light and dark mode.\nYou will learn how to set up a basic Next.js application with Chakra-UI integration.\n\n\n\n\n  Creating the Next.js application and installing the dependencies","Creating the Next.js application and installing the dependencies\n\nFirst we need to create a new Next.js app and install the dependencies needed for the example.\nThe Next.js app can be created via the following command:\n\n\n\nnpx create-next-app@latest\n\n\n\n\n\nEnter fullscreen mode\n\n\nExit fullscreen mode\n\n\n\n\n\nThis will set up the Next.js project automatically for you.\nNext we need to install Chakra-ui which can be done via the following command:\n\n\n\nyarn add @chakra-ui/react @emotion/react@^11 @emotion/styled@^11 framer-motion@^4 @chakra-ui/icons\n\n\n\n\n\nEnter fullscreen mode\n\n\nExit fullscreen mode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Creating fake Users\n\nNext we will need some fake users to actually populate the page. \nCreate a \"data\" folder in the root directory and create a \"users.js\" file and populate it with the following data: (feel free to use your own custom data but be careful of the parameter names):\nhttps://github.com/ethand91/nextjs-chakra-sample/blob/main/data/users.js\n\n\n\n\n  Creating the components","Creating the components\n\nNext we need to create the components needed for the sample page, create a new folder called \"components\" and within that create a \"TopBar\" folder.\nWithin the TopBar folder create a new file called \"index.js\" and populate it with the following contents:\n\n\n\nimport {\n  Box,\n  Button,\n  useColorMode\n} from '@chakra-ui/react';\nimport { MoonIcon, SunIcon } from '@chakra-ui/icons';\n\nfunction TopBar() {\n  const { colorMode, toggleColorMode } = useColorMode();\n  const ColorModeIcon = colorMode === 'light' ? SunIcon : MoonIcon;\n\n  return (\n    <Box width=\"100%\" padding=\"1\" backgroundColor=\"purple.700\">\n      <Box maxWidth=\"container.xl\" margin=\"auto\">\n        <Button\n          aria-label=\"ui theme\"\n          leftIcon={ <ColorModeIcon /> }\n          onClick={ toggleColorMode }\n          size=\"xs\"\n          marginRight=\"2\"\n          borderRadius=\"sm\"\n        >\n          Toggle Theme\n        </Button>\n      </Box>\n    </Box>\n  );  \n};\n\nexport default TopBar;","export default TopBar;\n\n\n\n\n\nEnter fullscreen mode\n\n\nExit fullscreen mode\n\n\n\n\n\nHere we create a simple top bar for the application, we give it a background color of purple and also provide a button that allows the user to toggle between light/dark mode using Chakra-UI.\nNext we need a component to display the users, so create a new \"UserCard\" directory and within that directory create an \"index.js\" file and populate it with the following contents:\n\n\n\nimport Link from 'next/link';\nimport {\n  Box,\n  Text,\n  Avatar,\n  Center,\n  VStack,\n  useColorModeValue\n} from '@chakra-ui/react';","function UserCard(props) {\n  return (\n    <Link href={ `/users/${props.username}` } passHref>\n      <VStack\n        spacing=\"4\"\n        borderRadius=\"md\"\n        boxShadow=\"x1\"\n        padding=\"5\"\n        backgroundColor={\n          useColorModeValue('gray.50', 'gray.700')\n        }\n      >   \n        <Center>\n          <Avatar size=\"lg\" src={ props.avatar } />\n        </Center>\n        <Center>\n          <Box textAlign=\"center\">\n            <Text fontWeight=\"bold\" fontSize=\"xl\">\n              { props.first_name } { props.last_name }\n            </Text>\n            <Text fontSize=\"xs\">{ props.job_title }</Text>\n          </Box>\n        </Center>\n      </VStack>\n    </Link>\n  );  \n};\n\nexport default UserCard;\n\n\n\n\n\nEnter fullscreen mode\n\n\nExit fullscreen mode\n\n\n\n\n\nThis card will link to the user details page, using Chakra-UI we are easily able to center contents using \"Center\". We also use Avatar to easily display the user's profile picture.\nThats the components created.","Creating the Pages\n\nNext we need to start working on the pages.\nWe will be overriding the default Next.js document which can be done by creating a \"_document.js\" inside the pages directory. \nCreate the file and populate it with the following:\n\n\n\nimport { ColorModeScript } from '@chakra-ui/react';\nimport NextDocument, {\n  Html,\n  Head,\n  Main,\n  NextScript\n} from 'next/document';\nimport { extendTheme } from '@chakra-ui/react';\n\nconst config = { \n  useSystemColorMode: true\n};\n\nconst theme = extendTheme({ config }); \n\nexport default class Document extends NextDocument {\n  render () {\n    return (\n      <Html lang=\"en\">\n        <Head />\n        <body>\n          <ColorModeScript\n            initialColorMode={ theme.config.initialColorMode }\n          />\n          <Main />\n          <NextScript />\n        </body>\n      </Html>\n    );  \n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nEnter fullscreen mode\n\n\nExit fullscreen mode","Enter fullscreen mode\n\n\nExit fullscreen mode\n\n\n\n\n\nThe reason for overriding the default layout is because we want to apply both light/dark theme to the entire page.\nNext we need to apply Chara-UI to the application so open up pages/_app.js and change the contents to the following:\n\n\n\nimport { ChakraProvider, Box } from '@chakra-ui/react';\nimport TopBar from './../components/TopBar';\n\nfunction MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {\n  return (\n    <ChakraProvider>\n      <TopBar />\n      <Box maxWidth=\"container.xl\" margin=\"auto\">\n        <Component { ...pageProps} />\n      </Box>\n    </ChakraProvider>\n  );  \n}\n\nexport default MyApp\n\n\n\n\n\nEnter fullscreen mode\n\n\nExit fullscreen mode\n\n\n\n\n\nHere we bascially tell Next.js to use the Chara-UI provider and make sure everypage has our custom TopBar.\nNext we need to edit the pages/index.js to contain the following contents:\n\n\n\nimport {\n  Box,\n  Grid,\n  Text,\n  GridItem\n} from '@chakra-ui/react';","import {\n  Box,\n  Grid,\n  Text,\n  GridItem\n} from '@chakra-ui/react';\n\nimport UserCard from './../components/UserCard';\nimport users from './../data/users';\n\nexport default function Home() {\n  return (\n    <Box>\n      <Text\n        fontSize=\"xxx-large\"\n        fontWeight=\"extrabold\"\n        textAlign=\"center\"\n        marginTop=\"9\"\n      >   \n        Users\n      </Text>\n\n      <Grid\n        gridTemplateColumns={ ['1fr', 'repeat(2, 1fr)', 'repeat(3, 1fr)'] }\n        gridGap=\"10\"\n        padding=\"10\"\n      >   \n        {\n          users.map((user) => (\n            <GridItem key={ user.id }>\n              <UserCard { ...user } />\n            </GridItem>\n          ))\n        }\n      </Grid>\n    </Box>\n  );  \n}\n\n\n\n\n\nEnter fullscreen mode\n\n\nExit fullscreen mode","Enter fullscreen mode\n\n\nExit fullscreen mode\n\n\n\n\n\nHere we basically list all the users using Chakra-UI's Grid component. The \"gridTemplateColumns\" allows us to set the sizes for small screens, medium screens and large screens. For example if you view the page on a large screen each row will have 3 users, however if you view it on a mobile device each row will only have one user.\nFeel free to run the project using:\n\n\n\nnpm run dev\n\n\n\n\n\nEnter fullscreen mode\n\n\nExit fullscreen mode\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you access the page (https://localhost:3000), you should see the following page:\n\nIf you prefer light mode you should see the following:","If you prefer light mode you should see the following:\n\nFeel free to play with the toggle button. If you try clicking on a user you will be greeted with a 404 not found response so let's create the user profile page!\nCreate a \"users\" folder inside the pages folder and create the \"[username].js\". (Note if you're using a terminal like me you may need to escape the brackets with a backslash).\nNow fill the file with the following contents:\n\n\n\nmport Link from 'next/link';\nimport {\n  Avatar,\n  Box,\n  Center,\n  Text,\n  Image,\n  Button,\n  Flex,\n  useColorModeValue\n} from '@chakra-ui/react';\n\nimport users from './../../data/users';\n\nexport function getStaticPaths() {\n  const paths = users.map((user) => ({\n    params: {\n      username: user.username\n    }   \n  }));\n\n  return {\n    paths,\n    fallback: false\n  };  \n}\n\nexport function getStaticProps({ params }) {\n  const { username } = params;","export function getStaticProps({ params }) {\n  const { username } = params;\n\n  return { \n    props: {\n      user: users.find((user) => user.username === username)\n    }   \n  };  \n};\n\nfunction UserPage({ user }) {\n  return (\n    <Center\n      marginTop={ ['0', '0', '8' ] }\n      boxShadow=\"lg\"\n      minHeight=\"fit-content\"\n    >\n      <Box>\n        <Box position=\"relative\">\n          <Image src={user.cover_image} width=\"fit-content\" height=\"250px\" objectFit=\"cover\" />\n\n          <Flex\n            alignItems=\"flex-end\"\n            position=\"absolute\"\n            top=\"0\"\n            left=\"0\"\n            backgroundColor={\n              useColorModeValue('blackAlpha.400', 'blackAlpha.600')\n            }\n            width=\"100%\"\n            height=\"100%\"\n            padding=\"8\"\n            color=\"white\"","<Avatar size=\"lg\" src={ user.avatar } />\n            <Box marginLeft=\"6\">\n              <Text as=\"h1\" fontSize=\"xx-large\" fontWeight=\"bold\">\n                { user.first_name } { user.last_name }\n              </Text>\n              <Text as=\"p\" fontSize=\"large\" lineHeight=\"1.5\">\n                { user.job_title }\n              </Text>\n            </Box>\n          </Flex>\n        </Box>\n        <Box\n          maxW=\"container.xl\"\n          margin=\"auto\"\n          padding=\"8\"\n          backgroundColor={\n            useColorModeValue('white', 'gray.700')\n          }\n        >\n          <Text as=\"p\">{ user.description }</Text>\n          <Link href=\"/\" passHref>\n            <Button marginTop=\"8\" colorScheme=\"whatsapp\" as=\"a\">\n              Back to all users\n            </Button>\n          </Link>\n        </Box>\n      </Box>\n    </Center>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default UserPage;\n\n\n\n\n\nEnter fullscreen mode\n\n\nExit fullscreen mode","export default UserPage;\n\n\n\n\n\nEnter fullscreen mode\n\n\nExit fullscreen mode\n\n\n\n\n\nPhew! Here we use \"getStaticPaths\" to tell Next.js we need to render a new page for each user in the user's array.\nWe also tell Next.js to display the default 404 page if the requested user is not found.\nChakra-UI allows us to easily center the contents. This page basically displays the contents of the user and provides a button to go back using a Chakra-UI feature.\nAll done fire up the dev server and load up https://localhost:3000 in the browser. \nOnce loading try clicking on a user you should see the following page:\n\n\nAll done! üòé\n\n\n\n\n  Conclusion\n\nHere I have demonstrated how to use Next.js with Chakra-UI.

‚ÄúFast, disk space efficient package manager‚Äù. Apart from being fast, up to 2x faster than other package managers (see benchmarks), and space efficient, it also has a version manager baked in.Add out-of-the-box monorepo support i.e. support for multiple packages in the same project, cross-platform reliability, and checksum and integrity testing to handle security (cough NPM bad package vulnerabilities cough), and you have a package manager rapidly winning the hearts of JS developers everywhere.PNPM is actively used in production by big companies like ByteDance, Vercel, Microsoft,","everywhere.PNPM is actively used in production by big companies like ByteDance, Vercel, Microsoft, Prezi, and JustAnswer, just to name a few ‚Äî it has been production-ready for more than 6 years now.In this first article in the Next-PNPM series, we will be looking at how we can create a NextJS app using PNPM, and how we can fully use this powerful package manager to power your next Next application.NextJS x PNPM seriesInstalling PNPMFirst, install PNPM in case you haven‚Äôt already.$ npm i -g pnpmVerify installation using pnpm --version .Using The Create ToolTo create a Next app with PNPM, we will be using the create CLI tool(see docs) that PNPM provides us. This is similar to the create utility in yarn. It can be used to create a project from create-* or @foo/create-* starter kits, like create-react-app or create-next-app .Now, create a NextJS project using pnpm using the command:$ pnpm create next-app new-next-appTo create a project with Typescript, run:$ pnpm create next-app","pnpm create next-app new-next-appTo create a project with Typescript, run:$ pnpm create next-app ts-next-app --template typescriptThis will create a new new-next-app / ts-next-app project directory where your Next application is housed.PNPM creates a pnpm-lock.yaml file to store the dependency tree which is similar to package-lock.json or yarn.lock that are created by npm and yarn.Running Project and Project ScriptsNow that you have a project created, cd into the project. You can run pnpm run dev to run the development server.$ cd new-next-app$ pnpm run devSimilarly, you also run project scripts just the way you would with npm. You can also define your own scripts inside the package.json file and run it with npm the same way you would with plain npm .And‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs it! You can now successfully use PNPM to manage your project packages and dependencies, and take advantage of the blazing-fast downloads, security, and monorepo support it has to offer ‚Äî all without tearing a hole in your hard","downloads, security, and monorepo support it has to offer ‚Äî all without tearing a hole in your hard drive.In the next article in this series, we will be looking at how we can migrate an existing Next project from npm or yarn to pnpm, and manage mono repo using pnpm ‚Äî so stay tuned!NextjsFront End DevelopmentPnpmReactFrontend----FollowPublished in readytowork, Inc.89 Followers¬∑Last published¬†6 days agoCollaborating to incorporate latest trends & technologies in products & services to serve betterFollowFollowWritten by Rojan Rajbhandari22 Followers¬∑2 FollowingSoftware Engineer and Writer.

For example if the user sets their computer to dark mode by default, Chakra-UI will default to dark mode.\nComposibility: Components can be created from the Chakra-UI ones or if needed custom components can be created with ease.\nTypescript Support: Chakra-UI is written in TypeScript and provides class types for easy integration.\n\n\n\n\n\n  What we will be making\n\nIn this tutorial we will use Chakra-UI to create a simple user list/profile page. \nWe will also integrate a toggler to toggle between light and dark mode.\nYou will learn how to set up a basic Next.js application with Chakra-UI integration.\n\n\n\n\n  Creating the Next.js application and installing the dependencies","Creating the Next.js application and installing the dependencies\n\nFirst we need to create a new Next.js app and install the dependencies needed for the example.\nThe Next.js app can be created via the following command:\n\n\n\nnpx create-next-app@latest\n\n\n\n\n\nEnter fullscreen mode\n\n\nExit fullscreen mode\n\n\n\n\n\nThis will set up the Next.js project automatically for you.\nNext we need to install Chakra-ui which can be done via the following command:\n\n\n\nyarn add @chakra-ui/react @emotion/react@^11 @emotion/styled@^11 framer-motion@^4 @chakra-ui/icons\n\n\n\n\n\nEnter fullscreen mode\n\n\nExit fullscreen mode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Creating fake Users\n\nNext we will need some fake users to actually populate the page. \nCreate a \"data\" folder in the root directory and create a \"users.js\" file and populate it with the following data: (feel free to use your own custom data but be careful of the parameter names):\nhttps://github.com/ethand91/nextjs-chakra-sample/blob/main/data/users.js\n\n\n\n\n  Creating the components","Creating the components\n\nNext we need to create the components needed for the sample page, create a new folder called \"components\" and within that create a \"TopBar\" folder.\nWithin the TopBar folder create a new file called \"index.js\" and populate it with the following contents:\n\n\n\nimport {\n  Box,\n  Button,\n  useColorMode\n} from '@chakra-ui/react';\nimport { MoonIcon, SunIcon } from '@chakra-ui/icons';\n\nfunction TopBar() {\n  const { colorMode, toggleColorMode } = useColorMode();\n  const ColorModeIcon = colorMode === 'light' ? SunIcon : MoonIcon;\n\n  return (\n    <Box width=\"100%\" padding=\"1\" backgroundColor=\"purple.700\">\n      <Box maxWidth=\"container.xl\" margin=\"auto\">\n        <Button\n          aria-label=\"ui theme\"\n          leftIcon={ <ColorModeIcon /> }\n          onClick={ toggleColorMode }\n          size=\"xs\"\n          marginRight=\"2\"\n          borderRadius=\"sm\"\n        >\n          Toggle Theme\n        </Button>\n      </Box>\n    </Box>\n  );  \n};\n\nexport default TopBar;","export default TopBar;\n\n\n\n\n\nEnter fullscreen mode\n\n\nExit fullscreen mode\n\n\n\n\n\nHere we create a simple top bar for the application, we give it a background color of purple and also provide a button that allows the user to toggle between light/dark mode using Chakra-UI.\nNext we need a component to display the users, so create a new \"UserCard\" directory and within that directory create an \"index.js\" file and populate it with the following contents:\n\n\n\nimport Link from 'next/link';\nimport {\n  Box,\n  Text,\n  Avatar,\n  Center,\n  VStack,\n  useColorModeValue\n} from '@chakra-ui/react';","function UserCard(props) {\n  return (\n    <Link href={ `/users/${props.username}` } passHref>\n      <VStack\n        spacing=\"4\"\n        borderRadius=\"md\"\n        boxShadow=\"x1\"\n        padding=\"5\"\n        backgroundColor={\n          useColorModeValue('gray.50', 'gray.700')\n        }\n      >   \n        <Center>\n          <Avatar size=\"lg\" src={ props.avatar } />\n        </Center>\n        <Center>\n          <Box textAlign=\"center\">\n            <Text fontWeight=\"bold\" fontSize=\"xl\">\n              { props.first_name } { props.last_name }\n            </Text>\n            <Text fontSize=\"xs\">{ props.job_title }</Text>\n          </Box>\n        </Center>\n      </VStack>\n    </Link>\n  );  \n};\n\nexport default UserCard;\n\n\n\n\n\nEnter fullscreen mode\n\n\nExit fullscreen mode\n\n\n\n\n\nThis card will link to the user details page, using Chakra-UI we are easily able to center contents using \"Center\". We also use Avatar to easily display the user's profile picture.\nThats the components created.","Creating the Pages\n\nNext we need to start working on the pages.\nWe will be overriding the default Next.js document which can be done by creating a \"_document.js\" inside the pages directory. \nCreate the file and populate it with the following:\n\n\n\nimport { ColorModeScript } from '@chakra-ui/react';\nimport NextDocument, {\n  Html,\n  Head,\n  Main,\n  NextScript\n} from 'next/document';\nimport { extendTheme } from '@chakra-ui/react';\n\nconst config = { \n  useSystemColorMode: true\n};\n\nconst theme = extendTheme({ config }); \n\nexport default class Document extends NextDocument {\n  render () {\n    return (\n      <Html lang=\"en\">\n        <Head />\n        <body>\n          <ColorModeScript\n            initialColorMode={ theme.config.initialColorMode }\n          />\n          <Main />\n          <NextScript />\n        </body>\n      </Html>\n    );  \n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nEnter fullscreen mode\n\n\nExit fullscreen mode","Enter fullscreen mode\n\n\nExit fullscreen mode\n\n\n\n\n\nThe reason for overriding the default layout is because we want to apply both light/dark theme to the entire page.\nNext we need to apply Chara-UI to the application so open up pages/_app.js and change the contents to the following:\n\n\n\nimport { ChakraProvider, Box } from '@chakra-ui/react';\nimport TopBar from './../components/TopBar';\n\nfunction MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {\n  return (\n    <ChakraProvider>\n      <TopBar />\n      <Box maxWidth=\"container.xl\" margin=\"auto\">\n        <Component { ...pageProps} />\n      </Box>\n    </ChakraProvider>\n  );  \n}\n\nexport default MyApp\n\n\n\n\n\nEnter fullscreen mode\n\n\nExit fullscreen mode\n\n\n\n\n\nHere we bascially tell Next.js to use the Chara-UI provider and make sure everypage has our custom TopBar.\nNext we need to edit the pages/index.js to contain the following contents:\n\n\n\nimport {\n  Box,\n  Grid,\n  Text,\n  GridItem\n} from '@chakra-ui/react';","import {\n  Box,\n  Grid,\n  Text,\n  GridItem\n} from '@chakra-ui/react';\n\nimport UserCard from './../components/UserCard';\nimport users from './../data/users';\n\nexport default function Home() {\n  return (\n    <Box>\n      <Text\n        fontSize=\"xxx-large\"\n        fontWeight=\"extrabold\"\n        textAlign=\"center\"\n        marginTop=\"9\"\n      >   \n        Users\n      </Text>\n\n      <Grid\n        gridTemplateColumns={ ['1fr', 'repeat(2, 1fr)', 'repeat(3, 1fr)'] }\n        gridGap=\"10\"\n        padding=\"10\"\n      >   \n        {\n          users.map((user) => (\n            <GridItem key={ user.id }>\n              <UserCard { ...user } />\n            </GridItem>\n          ))\n        }\n      </Grid>\n    </Box>\n  );  \n}\n\n\n\n\n\nEnter fullscreen mode\n\n\nExit fullscreen mode","Enter fullscreen mode\n\n\nExit fullscreen mode\n\n\n\n\n\nHere we basically list all the users using Chakra-UI's Grid component. The \"gridTemplateColumns\" allows us to set the sizes for small screens, medium screens and large screens. For example if you view the page on a large screen each row will have 3 users, however if you view it on a mobile device each row will only have one user.\nFeel free to run the project using:\n\n\n\nnpm run dev\n\n\n\n\n\nEnter fullscreen mode\n\n\nExit fullscreen mode\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you access the page (https://localhost:3000), you should see the following page:\n\nIf you prefer light mode you should see the following:","If you prefer light mode you should see the following:\n\nFeel free to play with the toggle button. If you try clicking on a user you will be greeted with a 404 not found response so let's create the user profile page!\nCreate a \"users\" folder inside the pages folder and create the \"[username].js\".

Here we use \"getStaticPaths\" to tell Next.js we need to render a new page for each user in the user's array.\nWe also tell Next.js to display the default 404 page if the requested user is not found.\nChakra-UI allows us to easily center the contents. This page basically displays the contents of the user and provides a button to go back using a Chakra-UI feature.\nAll done fire up the dev server and load up https://localhost:3000 in the browser. \nOnce loading try clicking on a user you should see the following page:\n\n\nAll done! üòé\n\n\n\n\n  Conclusion\n\nHere I have demonstrated how to use Next.js with Chakra-UI.

If you‚Äôre not already using v7, upgrade with this command:\n\n npmnpx storybook@latest upgrade\n\nAutomatic migration\nWhen running the upgrade command above, you should get a prompt asking you to migrate to @storybook/nextjs, which should handle everything for you. In case that auto-migration does not work for your project, refer to the manual migration below.\nManual migration\nFirst, install the framework:\n\n npmnpm install --save-dev @storybook/nextjs\n\nThen, update your .storybook/main.js|ts to change the framework property:","Then, update your .storybook/main.js|ts to change the framework property:\n\n .storybook/main.tsTypescriptimport { StorybookConfig } from '@storybook/nextjs';\n \nconst config: StorybookConfig = {\n  // ...\n  // framework: '@storybook/react-webpack5', üëà Remove this\n  framework: '@storybook/nextjs', // üëà Add this\n};\n \nexport default config;\n\nFinally, if you were using Storybook plugins to integrate with Next.js, those are no longer necessary when using this framework and can be removed:\n\n .storybook/main.tsTypescriptimport { StorybookConfig } from '@storybook/nextjs';\n \nconst config: StorybookConfig = {\n  // ...\n  addons: [\n    // ...\n    // üëá These can both be removed\n    // 'storybook-addon-next',\n    // 'storybook-addon-next-router',\n  ],\n};\n \nexport default config;","With Vite\n(‚ö†Ô∏è Experimental)\nYou can use our freshly baked, experimental @storybook/experimental-nextjs-vite framework, which is based on Vite and removes the need for Webpack and Babel.

This follows Node package standards and has benefits when mocking modules.","To configure subpath imports, you define the imports property in your project's package.json file. This property maps the subpath to the actual file path. The example below configures subpath imports for all modules in the project:\n // package.json\n{\n  \"imports\": {\n    \"#*\": [\"./*\", \"./*.ts\", \"./*.tsx\"]\n  }\n}\n‚ÑπÔ∏èBecause subpath imports replace module aliases, you can remove the path aliases from your TypeScript configuration.\nWhich can then be used like this:\n // index.jsx\nimport Button from '#components/button';\nimport styles from '#styles/HomePage.module.css';\n \nexport default function HomePage() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <h1 className={styles.title}>Hello World</h1>\n      <Button />\n    </>\n  );\n}\nMocking modules","<h1 className={styles.title}>Hello World</h1>\n      <Button />\n    </>\n  );\n}\nMocking modules\nComponents often depend on modules that are imported into the component file. These can be from external packages or internal to your project. When rendering those components in Storybook or testing them, you may want to mock those modules to control and assert their behavior.\nBuilt-in mocked modules\nThis framework provides mocks for many of Next.js' internal modules:","@storybook/nextjs/cache.mock\n@storybook/nextjs/headers.mock\n@storybook/nextjs/navigation.mock\n@storybook/nextjs/router.mock\n\nMocking other modules\nHow you mock other modules in Storybook depends on how you import the module into your component.\nWith either approach, the first step is to create a mock file. Here's an example of a mock file for a module named session:\n\n lib/session.mock.tsimport { fn } from '@storybook/test';\nimport * as actual from './session';\n \nexport * from './session';\nexport const getUserFromSession = fn(actual.getUserFromSession).mockName('getUserFromSession');\n\nWith subpath imports\nIf you're using subpath imports, you can adjust your configuration to apply conditions so that the mocked module is used inside Storybook. The example below configures subpath imports for four internal modules, which are then mocked in Storybook:","package.json{\n  \"imports\": {\n    \"#api\": {\n      // storybook condition applies to Storybook\n      \"storybook\": \"./api.mock.ts\",\n      \"default\": \"./api.ts\",\n    },\n    \"#app/actions\": {\n      \"storybook\": \"./app/actions.mock.ts\",\n      \"default\": \"./app/actions.ts\",\n    },\n    \"#lib/session\": {\n      \"storybook\": \"./lib/session.mock.ts\",\n      \"default\": \"./lib/session.ts\",\n    },\n    \"#lib/db\": {\n      // test condition applies to test environments *and* Storybook\n      \"test\": \"./lib/db.mock.ts\",\n      \"default\": \"./lib/db.ts\",\n    },\n    \"#*\": [\"./*\", \"./*.ts\", \"./*.tsx\"],\n  },\n}\n\n‚ÑπÔ∏èEach subpath must begin with #, to differentiate it from a regular module path. The #* entry is a catch-all that maps all subpaths to the root directory.\nWith module aliases\nIf you're using module aliases, you can add a Webpack alias to your Storybook configuration to point to the mock file.","vitewebpack .storybook/main.tsTypescript// Replace your-framework with the framework you are using (e.g., react-webpack5, vue3-vite)\nimport type { StorybookConfig } from '@storybook/your-framework';\n \nconst config: StorybookConfig = {\n  framework: '@storybook/your-framework',\n  stories: ['../src/**/*.mdx', '../src/**/*.stories.@(js|jsx|mjs|ts|tsx)'],\n  viteFinal: async (config) => {\n    if (config.resolve) {\n      config.resolve.alias = {\n        ...config.resolve?.alias,\n        // üëá External module\n        lodash: require.resolve('./lodash.mock'),\n        // üëá Internal modules\n        '@/api': path.resolve(__dirname, './api.mock.ts'),\n        '@/app/actions': path.resolve(__dirname, './app/actions.mock.ts'),\n        '@/lib/session': path.resolve(__dirname, './lib/session.mock.ts'),\n        '@/lib/db': path.resolve(__dirname, './lib/db.mock.ts'),\n      };\n    }\n \n    return config;\n  },\n};\n \nexport default config;","Runtime config\nNext.js allows for Runtime Configuration which lets you import a handy getConfig function to get certain configuration defined in your next.config.js file at runtime.\nIn the context of Storybook with this framework, you can expect Next.js's Runtime Configuration feature to work just fine.\nNote, because Storybook doesn't server render your components, your components will only see what they normally see on the client side (i.e. they won't see serverRuntimeConfig but will see publicRuntimeConfig).\nFor example, consider the following Next.js config:\n // next.config.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  serverRuntimeConfig: {\n    mySecret: 'secret',\n    secondSecret: process.env.SECOND_SECRET, // Pass through env variables\n  },\n  publicRuntimeConfig: {\n    staticFolder: '/static',\n  },\n};\nCalls to getConfig would return the following object when called within Storybook:\n // Runtime config\n{\n  \"serverRuntimeConfig\": {},\n  \"publicRuntimeConfig\": {\n    \"staticFolder\": \"/static\"\n  }\n}","{\n  \"serverRuntimeConfig\": {},\n  \"publicRuntimeConfig\": {\n    \"staticFolder\": \"/static\"\n  }\n}\nCustom Webpack config\n‚ÑπÔ∏èYou can safely skip this section if you are using @storybook/experimental-nextjs-vite instead of @storybook/nextjs.\nThe Vite-based Next.js framework does not support Webpack settings.\nNext.js comes with a lot of things for free out of the box like Sass support, but sometimes you add custom Webpack config modifications to Next.js. This framework takes care of most of the Webpack modifications you would want to add. If Next.js supports a feature out of the box, then that feature will work out of the box in Storybook. If Next.js doesn't support something out of the box, but makes it easy to configure, then this framework will do the same for that thing for Storybook.\nAny Webpack modifications desired for Storybook should be made in .storybook/main.js|ts.","Any Webpack modifications desired for Storybook should be made in .storybook/main.js|ts.\nNote: Not all Webpack modifications are copy/paste-able between next.config.js and .storybook/main.js|ts.

If this is the case for you, please install the package directly.\nFAQ\nStories for pages/components which fetch data\nNext.js pages can fetch data directly within server components in the app directory, which often include module imports that only run in a node environment. This does not (currently) work within Storybook, because if you import from a Next.js page file containing those node module imports in your stories, your Storybook's Webpack will crash because those modules will not run in a browser. To get around this, you can extract the component in your page file into a separate file and import that pure component in your stories.

Now image imports work the \"Next.js way\", meaning that you now get an object when importing an image. For example:\n // Image import object\n{","// Image import object\n{\n  \"src\": \"static/media/stories/assets/logo.svg\",\n  \"height\": 48,\n  \"width\": 48,\n  \"blurDataURL\": \"static/media/stories/assets/logo.svg\"\n}\nTherefore, if something in Storybook isn't showing the image properly, make sure you expect the object to be returned from an import instead of only the asset path.\nSee local images for more detail on how Next.js treats static image imports.\nModule not found: Error: Can't resolve package name\nYou might get this if you're using Yarn v2 or v3.

Storybook is a fantastic way to demo your components in isolation from where they might be used in the application. That can be really handy when you're working with your designer or your product manager to hone in on the UI of just specific components in your application. All right. Let's start off by building our application.","00:22 We're going to call it Storybook with Next.js. This is really simple, so it'll be really quick. I'll start off with all my defaults. Yes to TypeScript, yes to ESLint, yes to Tailwind, Yes to the source directory, of course. Yes to the app router.\n00:36 And no to changing the import alias. I'll bring that up in VS Code. And in that console, I'm gonna do mpx to run Storybook at the latest version. And I'm gonna run the init command on that to initialize our project with Storybook. Looks like it's doing a good job identifying that this is the next application.\n00:56 Now it's actually going to launch Storybook for us. To be honest, I kind of find that more of a hassle. We're going to skip the tour and I'll just show you around myself. So here is our example button. So this is the idea that you have this kind of panel over on the side where you can navigate around and see the different components that you have and actually go and try them out.","01:16 For example, with our button case we can actually change the label here. So I can say, hello there. And you can kind of see how your component reacts to different prop changes. It's really nice. You can deploy this in isolation and let your designer or your product manager try out the different options before it actually goes in the application.\n01:35 It's fantastic, particularly for design systems. All right, let's go take a look at our project and see how it's actually integrated. So over in the source directory, we have a stories folder that has been added. It's got a bunch of assets. It's got, for example, our button in there.\n01:50 This is our button implementation. And then you've got some stories around it. So that's button.stories.ts. Importantly in the stories, there's the meta block and the meta block defines the metadata for your component. So in this case, we got the title.","02:03 That's where it's actually gonna put it in the nav bar. So it's gonna put it under example and then slash button. You're gonna give it the component, which in this case is the button. Any parameters for the story in general, it's gonna lay out in the center. The tags auto docs means that it's going to automatically generate documentation from the stories, which we'll see below.\n02:22 Then you got the different argument types in this case, our background color, we want a color selector on that. And then any default arguments. Now in the case of our button, we've got a bunch of different stories, and each one of those stories comes with different arguments to show off different aspects of your component. Now let's actually try and bring this button into our app. So what I'm gonna do is I'm going to move out button and button stories into our app.","02:53 And I'm gonna get rid of the stories altogether. Now over in button, I'm going to not use the styles. I'm gonna go and use Tailwind for this. So I'm just gonna create a whole new button. It does take a label which is a string.\n03:06 I'm gonna wrap button around that and I'll just give it some nice Tailwind styling. Okay that should be good. Let's go over and take a look at our button stories. Now we're exporting as the default so I no longer need to bring it in as a named constant. We don't have the background color controlling more or an on click.\n03:30 And I'll get rid of the primary here. In fact, I'll get rid of everything except the primary story. All right, let's give it a go. So to run this, I'm going to use pnpm storybook. Now that's actually been created over here in our package.json.","03:49 When we did the storybook init, it automatically added storybook and build storybook. Storybook is essentially dev mode for storybook and build storybook builds a static storybook that you can then deploy on something like S3. So let's run Storybook. All right, there you go, looks really great. It's up and running and we can even change the label.\n04:13 Fantastic. So there it is, a quick and easy way to get Storybook into your Next.js application. They make it super easy. You should go and check out the documentation. There's a whole lot more that comes with Storybook that you should go and check out.","04:26 It is a fantastic platform. We're going to take a look at it again when it comes to monorepos because there's a whole lot more involved when it comes to bringing it into a monorepo and where exactly you want to share your storybook from, whether it is the applications or a shared design system package or all of the applications in kind of a meta storybook. There's a lot of different ways you can roll it out there.Workshop ContentslessonSetting up Storybook with Next.jsJack HerringtonCodeNOTE: To get Tailwind to work in your Storybook previews you'll need to import your globals.css into preview.ts\n// .storybook/preview.ts\nimport \"../src/app/globals.css\"","Storybook is a great way to demo and test your components in isolation, separate from your main application. This makes it a valuable tool for working with designers and product managers, letting you focus on the UI and functionality of individual components.\nCreating a Next.js Project\nTo get started, let's create a new Next.js project using the create-next-app command:\npnpm dlx create-next-app@latest storybook-with-nextjs --use-pnpm\n\nSelect the options for TypeScript, ESLint, Tailwind CSS, and the app router when prompted.\nNext, we'll install Storybook and set it up in our project:\nnpx storybook@latest init","Storybook will detect that we're using a Next.js project and configure itself accordingly. When installation is complete, Storybook will automatically launch in your browser.\nNavigating Storybook\nStorybook has a sidebar with the components you've added, like the example button. You can navigate through these components, change their props, and see how they behave in different scenarios.\n\nProject Structure\nInside of the src directory, Storybook adds a stories folder with example components like the button. The button component itself is implemented in Button.tsx, and its stories are defined in Button.stories.ts.\nThe Button.stories.ts file has a meta block that specifies metadata for the component, like its title, location in the navigation bar, and the component itself. It also has an argTypes section that defines the available props for the button and how they should appear in the Storybook UI.\n// inside Button.stories.ts","const meta = {\n  title: 'Example/Button',\n  component: Button,\n  parameters: {\n    layout: 'centered',\n  },\n  tags: ['autodocs'],\n  argTypes: {\n    backgroundColor: { control: 'color' },\n  }\n}\n\nAfter the meta block, you'll see individual stories for the button component. Each story shows a different use case or variation of the component with specific props:\nexport const Primary: Story = {\n  args: {\n    primary: true,\n    label: 'Button',\n  },\n};\n\nexport const Secondary: Story = {\n  args: {\n    label: 'Button',\n  },\n};\n\nexport const Large: Story = {\n  args: {\n    size: 'large',\n    label: 'Button',\n  },\n};","export const Large: Story = {\n  args: {\n    size: 'large',\n    label: 'Button',\n  },\n};\n\nIntegrating a Custom Button Component\nLet's bring the button component into our app.\nFirst move the Button.tsx and Button.stories.ts files from the stories directory to the app directory, then remove the stories directory.\nNow, let's add our own button component to Storybook. We'll move the existing Button and Button.stories.tsx files from the stories directory into our app directory.\nOpen the demo Button.tsx file and replace the existing code with this new button that uses Tailwind CSS for styling:\nexport default function Button({ label }: { label: string }) {\n  return (\n    <button className=\"px-5 py-2 bg-blue-800 text-white text-2xl\">\n      {label}\n    </button>\n  );\n}","This code defines a simple button component using Tailwind CSS classes for styling.\nNext, open the Button.stories.tsx file and update it like this:\nimport type { Meta, StoryObj } from '@storybook/react'\nimport Button from './Button'\n\nconst meta = {\n  title: 'Example/Button',\n  component: Button,\n  parameters: {\n    layout: 'centered',\n  },\n  tags: ['autodocs'],\n  argTypes: {\n    backgroundColor: { control: 'color' },\n  }\n} satisfies Meta<typeof Button>\n\nexport default meta\ntype Story = StoryObj<typeof meta>\n\nexport const Primary: Story = {\n  args: {\n    label: 'Button',\n  },\n}\n\nThis code defines the meta information for our button component and includes a single story named \"Primary\" that renders the button with the label \"Button\".\nRunning Storybook\nWith our button component integrated, we can now run Storybook again:\npnpm storybook","There is also a build-storybook script that has been added to the package.json file. This script generates a static version of Storybook that you can deploy own its own.","You should now see our custom button component in the Storybook UI, with the Tailwind CSS styling. You can interact with the component, change its label, and explore its behavior in isolation.\nNext Steps\nThere's a lot more that Storybook can do beyond the example here. Check out the Storybook docs to learn more about its features and how to make the most of it in your projects.\nWe'll be revisiting Storybook later when we look at integrating it into monorepos and shared design systems.Transcript00:00 Let me show you how to set up the awesome Storybook with Next.js.

@chantasticLast updated: Jul 03, 20242023 UPDATE: Storybook created a zero-config integration with NextJS. Learn how to use it here.Next.js is a fantastic framework for building high-performance applications in React. But as it becomes more advanced ‚Äî with features like next/image ‚Äî it becomes more difficult to integrate with documentation and testing environments like Storybook.I dove in deep to learn how to make Storybook the best component-driven UI environment for Next.js pages. This article shows you how to do the same in four straightforward steps:üì¶ Initialize a new Storybook with Webpack 5üìë Create stories for Next.js pagesüåé Import shared, global styles in preview.js‚¨áÔ∏è De-optimize Next Image for use in StoriesIf you prefer video, jump","global styles in preview.js‚¨áÔ∏è De-optimize Next Image for use in StoriesIf you prefer video, jump to the end. We cover all these steps (and more) in a 27 minute code-along YouTube video!Start with a Next.js AppBefore we start, we need a Next.js app. This tutorial uses the fantastic Getting Started guide on nextjs.org.A fresh Next.js app running in the browserI recommend following along in a new app and then repeating the steps in an existing one. Here is the complete source on Github, updated for Next.js 12.Initialize a new Storybook with Webpack 5Storybook has an initializer that does the heavy lifting for us: npx sb init. This script detects your project type and adapts to it. But we can also give it a few hints.Next.js v11 and later use Webpack 5. We can also use Webpack 5 in Storybook to get improved integration and performance. To do that we use the builder option and run this command:npx sb init --builder webpack5Read more about the benefits of Storybook's Webpack 5","this command:npx sb init --builder webpack5Read more about the benefits of Storybook's Webpack 5 builder.Create stories for full Next.js pagesNext.js and Storybook have extremely compatible component models. Next.js uses components for pages and Storybook uses components for documentation and testing. This makes Storybook a great component-driven development environment for Next.js!Let's create a story for our Next.js home page.Create a new file /stories/pages/home.stories.jsxImport /pages/index.jsExport a default story object, with title and component propertiesExport a story for Home// /stories/pages/home.stories.jsx","import Home from \"../../pages/index\";\n\nexport default {\n  title: \"Pages/Home\",\n  component: Home,\n};","export const HomePage = () => <Home />\nWe now have our Home page in Storybook. But it isn't much to look at yet. We need to import global styles.Import shared, global stylesheets in preview.jsMost apps have stylesheet for global resets or font styles that is shared globally. Our Next.js tutorial app holds global styles in /styles/globals.css.We can import our global stylesheet into our home.stories.jsx story file. But doing so would require a lot of duplication in story files ‚Äî a very error-prone process. It'd be better to import global stylesheets one for all stories.Storybook holds shared story configuration in .storybook/preview.js. This file controls the way all stories are rendered. Stylesheets can be imported with a module import:// .storybook/preview.js","import \"../styles/globals.css\";Story, before and after adding globals.css. Much better!We did it! Save for a broken image, our story looks like the homepage served from Next.js.For more ways to handle styles in Storybook, check out our Styling and CSS guide.De-optimize Next.js Image in storiesThe most challenging part of a Next.js and Storybook integration is handling images.Storybook must be configured to serve next/images in the /public directoryNext.js v10 and newer include the Next.js Image component. In their words, it's \"an extension of the HTML <img>element, evolved for the modern web.\" Utilizing it optimizes file size, visual stability, and load times. It's a marvel of UI engineering.Because Storybook runs these components in isolation of Next.js framework-integrations, we need to configure it in two important ways:Serve the Next.js public directory in StorybookAdd the unoptimized prop to Next.js Image component in all stories1. Serve the public directory in StorybookThe sb","prop to Next.js Image component in all stories1. Serve the public directory in StorybookThe sb init script creates two Storybook scripts in our package.json. Update both of them to serve the publicdirectory (where Next.js images are kept). The CLI option we use for this is -s. or --static-dir.// package.json","\"scripts\": {\n-    \"storybook\": \"start-storybook -p 6006\",\n-    \"build-storybook\": \"build-storybook\"\n+    \"storybook\": \"start-storybook -p 6006 -s ./public\",\n+    \"build-storybook\": \"build-storybook -s public\"\n}\nFind more CLI options in our CLI options doc. And learn more about Serving Static Files via Storybook.2. Use the unoptimized prop for Next.js Images in StorybookEverywhere that the Next.js Image component is used, images are served from a /_next-prefixed path. We want to utilize Next Image's prop APIs and attributes, but we don't want to require that the Next.js dev server be running. We can do exactly this with the unoptimized prop. But how do we do this in Storybook but not Next.js ü§îWith a bit of module trickery, we can de-optimize Next.js Image only in stories.// .storybook/preview.js\nimport * as NextImage from \"next/image\";\n\nconst OriginalNextImage = NextImage.default;","Object.defineProperty(NextImage, \"default\", {\n  configurable: true,\n  value: (props) => <OriginalNextImage {...props} unoptimized />,\n});","This snippet of configuration modifies how Storybook evaluates the next/image module. Anywhere that Next.js Image's default export is used, the unoptimized prop is applied.Restart your server and check out the Vercel SVG at the bottom. We're back in business!For more information on this technique, read How to Use the Next.js Image Component in Storybook ‚Äî a fantastic post by Jonas Schumacher.Next.js home page running as an app (left) and independently in Storybook (right).What's next?You've already done a great job with this Next.js and Storybook integration.

Its documentation is user-friendly to help you quickly learn how to use the components and take advantage of their various features.Commonly used Chakra ComponentsBefore we start building the landing page, there are some commonly used Chakra UI components you need to know.Box - This is the same as the HTML div element. It accepts props such as background color, size, width, padding, margin, etc. Flex - This is the same as a div element with its display set to flex. It accepts all the CSS flex attributes as props. Spacer - It is a child element of the Flex component. It determines how spaced the flex items should be. Icon - This allows us to add icons to our web applications. It accepts the icon as a prop and attributes such as box size, color, height, width, etc. Heading - This is the same as the HTML h-tags. ¬†Text - This is the same as the HTML","width, etc. Heading - This is the same as the HTML h-tags. ¬†Text - This is the same as the HTML paragraph tag.Button - This is the same as the HTML button tag.Setting up Chakra in NextJSTo install Chakra UI in a Next.js project, follow the steps below:Create the Next.js project by running the code below.$ npx create-next-app@12 chakra-ui-projectRun the code below to install Chakra UI and its dependencies. $ yarn add @chakra-ui/react @emotion/react @emotion/styled framer-motionWrap the entire app with the ChakraProvider component to enable us to use the Chakra UI components.import \"../styles/globals.css\";","import { ChakraProvider } from \"@chakra-ui/react\";","function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {\n   return (\n       <ChakraProvider>\n           <Component {...pageProps} />\n       </ChakraProvider>\n   );\n} \n\nexport default MyApp;Since there are icons on the web page, install the Chakra UI icon and the React Icons libraries.$ yarn add @chakra-ui/icons react-iconsHow to use fonts in ChakraHere, you'll learn how to use Google fonts in a Chakra UI project. Visit the Google font webpage for Montserrat, the one used in this project. Add all the font variants and copy the link for the font.Next, create a pages/_document.js file and copy the code below into the file. The _document.js file can update the HTML and BODY tags of a Next.js web page.import { Html, Head, Main, NextScript } from \"next/document\";","export default function Document() {\n   return (\n       <Html>\n           <Head>\n               <link rel='preconnect' href='https://fonts.googleapis.com' />\n               <link\n                   rel='preconnect'\n                   href='https://fonts.gstatic.com'\n                   crossOrigin='true'\n               />\n               <link\n                   href='https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Montserrat:wght@100;200;300;400;500;600;700;800;900&display=swap'\n                   rel='stylesheet'\n               />\n           </Head>\n           <body>\n               <Main />\n               <NextScript />\n           </body>\n       </Html>\n   );\n}Update the _app.js to add the Montserrat font to Chakra UI.import \"../styles/globals.css\";\nimport { ChakraProvider } from \"@chakra-ui/react\";\nimport { extendTheme } from \"@chakra-ui/react\";\n\n\nconst theme = extendTheme({\n   fonts: {\n       heading: `'Montserrat', sans-serif`,\n       body: `'Montserrat', sans-serif`,\n   },\n});","function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {\n   return (\n       <ChakraProvider theme={theme}>\n           <Component {...pageProps} />\n       </ChakraProvider>\n   );\n}","export default MyApp;The extendTheme function allows us to edit and extend the default UI styles provided by Chakra UI.Finally, copy the CSS code here into the styles/globals.css file.

Key updates include:\n\nReact 19 (stable): Support for React 19 is officially available in both Pages Router & App Router.\nImproved Error Debugging: Enhanced DX and better source maps for the browser and the terminal.\nafter (stable): New API to execute code after a response has finished streaming.\nforbidden / unauthorized (experimental): New APIs to enable more granular authentication error handling.","Upgrade today, or get started with:\nTerminal# Use the automated upgrade CLI\nnpx @next/codemod@canary upgrade latest\n \n# ...or upgrade manually\nnpm install next@latest react@latest react-dom@latest\n \n# ...or start a new project\nnpx create-next-app@latest\nReact 19 (stable)\n\n\n\n\n\nNext.js 15.1 now fully supports React 19:\n\nFor the Pages Router: you can now use React 19 stable without needing the Release Candidate or Canary releases, alongside continued support for React 18.\nFor the App Router: we will continue to provide React Canary releases built-in. These include all the stable React 19 changes, as well as newer features being validated in frameworks, prior to a new React release.\n\nSince the Next.js 15 release, a significant addition to React 19 was ‚Äúsibling pre-warming‚Äù.\nFor a comprehensive overview of React 19‚Äôs updates, please refer to the official React 19 blog post.\nImproved Error Debugging","We‚Äôve made improvements to error debugging in Next.js, ensuring you can quickly locate the source of issues, whether they appear in the terminal, browser, or attached debuggers. These enhancements apply to both Webpack and Turbopack (now stable with Next.js 15).\nSource Maps Enhancements\n\n\n\n\n\nErrors are now easier to trace back to their origin through the improved use of source maps. We‚Äôve implemented the ignoreList property of source maps, which allows Next.js to hide stack frames for external dependencies, making your application code the primary focus.\nFor slightly more accurate source mapping of method names, we suggest adopting Turbopack (now stable), which has improved handling and detection of source maps over Webpack.\n\nFor library authors: We recommend populating the ignoreList property in sourcemaps when publishing your libraries, especially if they are configured as external (e.g. in the serverExternalPackages config).\n\nCollapsed Stack Frames","Collapsed Stack Frames\n\n\n\n\n\nWe‚Äôve improved the logic for collapsing stack frames to highlight the most relevant parts of your code.\n\nIn the browser and error overlay: Stack frames from third-party dependencies are hidden by default, focusing on your application code. You can reveal the hidden frames by clicking ‚ÄúShow ignored frames‚Äù in the devtools or the overlay.\nIn the terminal: Third-party dependency frames are also collapsed by default, and error formatting now aligns with the browser output for a consistent debugging experience. Errors are replayed in the browser to ensure you don‚Äôt miss important information during development if you need the entire stack trace.\n\nEnhanced Profiling\n\n\n\n\n\nIgnored stack frames are also recognized by built-in browser profilers. This makes profiling your application easier, allowing you to pinpoint slow functions in your code without noise from external libraries.\nImproved with the Edge Runtime","When using the Edge runtime, errors are now displayed consistently across development environments, ensuring seamless debugging. Previously, logged errors would only include the message and not the stack.\nBefore and after","Terminal Before:\nTerminal ‚®Ø app/page.tsx (6:11) @ eval\n ‚®Ø Error: boom\n    at eval (./app/page.tsx:12:15)\n    at Page (./app/page.tsx:11:74)\n    at AsyncLocalStorage.run (node:async_hooks:346:14)\n    at stringify (<anonymous>)\n    at AsyncLocalStorage.run (node:async_hooks:346:14)\n    at AsyncResource.runInAsyncScope (node:async_hooks:206:9)\ndigest: \"380744807\"\n  4 | export default function Page() {\n  5 |   const throwError = myCallback(() => {\n> 6 |     throw new Error('boom')\n    |           ^\n  7 |   }, [])\n  8 |\n  9 |   throwError()\n GET / 500 in 2354ms\nTerminal After:\nTerminal  ‚®Ø Error: boom\n    at eval (app/page.tsx:6:10)\n    at Page (app/page.tsx:5:32)\n  4 | export default function Page() {\n  5 |   const throwError = myCallback(() => {\n> 6 |     throw new Error('boom')\n    |          ^\n  7 |   }, [])\n  8 |\n  9 |   throwError() {\n  digest: '225828171'\n}\nError Overlay Before\nAn example of the Next.js error overlay before version 15.1\nError Overlay After","An example of the Next.js error overlay before version 15.1\nError Overlay After\nAn example of the Next.js error overlay after version 15.1\nThese improvements make errors clearer and more intuitive, allowing you to focus your time building your application rather than debugging.\nWe‚Äôre also thrilled to announce the introduction of a redesigned UI for the error overlay, coming in upcoming releases.\nafter (stable)","The after() API is now stable following its introduction in the first Next.js 15 RC.\nafter() provides a way to perform tasks such as logging, analytics, and other system synchronization after the response has finished streaming to the user, without blocking the primary response.\nKey changes\n\n\n\n\n\nSince its introduction, we‚Äôve stabilized after() and addressed feedback including:\n\nImproved support for self-hosted Next.js servers.\nBug fixes for scenarios where after() interacted with other Next.js features.\nEnhanced extensibility, enabling other platforms to inject their own waitUntil() primitives to power after().\nSupport for runtime APIs such as cookies() and headers() in Server Actions and Route Handlers.","app/layout.jsimport { after } from 'next/server';\nimport { log } from '@/app/utils';\n \nexport default function Layout({ children }) {\n  // Secondary task\n  after(() => {\n    log();\n  });\n \n  // Primary task\n  return <>{children}</>;\n}\nRead more about the after API and how to leverage it in the documentation.\nforbidden and unauthorized (experimental)\n\n\n\n\n\nNext.js 15.1 includes two experimental APIs, forbidden() and unauthorized(), based on community feedback.\n\nWe‚Äôd love your feedback ‚Äî please try it in your development environments and share your thoughts in this discussion thread.\n\nOverview\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you‚Äôre familiar with the App Router, you‚Äôve likely used notFound() to trigger 404 behavior alongside the customizable not-found.tsx file. With version 15.1, we‚Äôre extending this approach to authorization errors:\n‚Ä¢ forbidden() triggers a 403 error with customizable UI via forbidden.tsx.\n‚Ä¢ unauthorized() triggers a 401 error with customizable UI via unauthorized.tsx.","Good to know: As with notFound() errors, the status code will be 200 if the error is triggered after initial response headers have been sent. Learn more.\n\nEnabling the feature\n\n\n\n\n\nAs this feature is still experimental, you‚Äôll need to enable it in your next.config.ts file:\nnext.config.tsimport type { NextConfig } from 'next';\n \nconst nextConfig: NextConfig = {\n  experimental: {\n    authInterrupts: true,\n  },\n};\n \nexport default nextConfig;\n\nNote: next.config.ts support was introduced in Next.js 15. Learn more.\n\nUsing forbidden() and unauthorized()","Using forbidden() and unauthorized()\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can use forbidden() and unauthorized() in Server Actions, Server Components, Client Components, or Route Handlers. Here‚Äôs an example:\nimport { verifySession } from '@/app/lib/dal';\nimport { forbidden } from 'next/navigation';\n \nexport default async function AdminPage() {\n  const session = await verifySession();\n \n  // Check if the user has the 'admin' role\n  if (session.role !== 'admin') {\n    forbidden();\n  }\n \n  // Render the admin page for authorized users\n  return <h1>Admin Page</h1>;\n}\nCreating custom error pages","To customize the error pages, create the following files:\napp/forbidden.tsximport Link from 'next/link';\n \nexport default function Forbidden() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h2>Forbidden</h2>\n      <p>You are not authorized to access this resource.</p>\n      <Link href=\"/\">Return Home</Link>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\napp/unauthorized.tsximport Link from 'next/link';\n \nexport default function Unauthorized() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h2>Unauthorized</h2>\n      <p>Please log in to access this page.</p>\n      <Link href=\"/login\">Go to Login</Link>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\nWe'd like to thank Clerk for proposing this feature through a PR and assisting us in prototyping the API. Before we stabilize this feature in 15.2, we're planning on adding more capabilities and improvements to the APIs to support a wider range of use cases.\nRead the documentation for the unauthorized and forbidden APIs for more details.\nOther Changes","[Feature] Use ESLint 9 in create-next-app (PR)\n[Feature] Increase max cache tags to 128 (PR)\n[Feature] Add an option to disable experimental CssChunkingPlugin (PR)\n[Feature] Add experimental CSS inlining support (PR)\n[Improvement] Silence Sass legacy-js-api warning (PR)\n[Improvement] Fix unhandled rejection when using rewrites (PR)\n[Improvement] Ensure parent process exits when webpack worker fails (PR)\n[Improvement] Fixed route interception on a catch-all route (PR)\n[Improvement] Fixed response cloning issue in request deduping (PR)\n[Improvement] Fixed Server Action redirects between multiple root layouts (PR)\n[Improvement] Support providing MDX plugins as strings for Turbopack compatibility (PR)\n\nContributors\n\n\n\n\n\nNext.js is the result of the combined work of over 3,000 individual developers.

of the React ecosystem. This update also includes several noteworthy improvements:\n\n\n\n  üåü 1. Compatibility with React 19\n\nReact 19 is one of the most significant updates to the library in recent years, introducing features like performance improvements, modernized APIs, and changes to rendering behavior.\nNext.js 15.1 has quickly adopted these changes, enabling developers to seamlessly leverage React 19‚Äôs latest features in their projects. This compatibility ensures a smooth experience for those migrating to React 19.\n\n\n\n\n  üõ†Ô∏è 2. Improved Debugging Tools","üõ†Ô∏è 2. Improved Debugging Tools\n\nDebugging complex applications is always a challenge. In this release, Next.js has enhanced its debugging tools to make error messages clearer and more precise.\nKey improvements include: \n\nMore detailed error messages.\n\nHighlighting exact locations in the code where issues occur.\n\nClear explanations of why certain errors happen.\n\n\nThese improvements make it easier for developers to identify and resolve problems, boosting productivity.  \n\n\n\n\n  ‚úÖ 3.

Introduction\nBrief Explanation\nAutomating everyday tasks with Python scripts is a powerful way to streamline workflows, reduce manual effort, and increase productivity. Python, with its simplicity, flexibility, and extensive libraries, is an ideal choice for automating tasks such as file management, data processing, system administration, and even interacting with web services.\nImportance\nAutomation eliminates repetitive tasks, reduces the potential for human error, and allows you to focus on more critical and creative work. By leveraging Python scripts, you can create custom solutions tailored to your specific needs, whether personal or professional.\nWhat Readers Will Learn\nBy the end of this tutorial, readers will learn how to:\n‚Äì Create Python scripts to automate common tasks\n‚Äì Use Python libraries for file operations, system interactions, and data manipulation\n‚Äì Handle errors and edge cases","‚Äì Handle errors and edge cases\n‚Äì Implement best practices for writing efficient and maintainable code\nPrerequisites","Basic understanding of Python programming concepts (variables, loops, functions)\nPython installed on your system (preferably Python 3.8 or later)\nFamiliarity with the command line or terminal\n\nTechnologies/Tools Needed\n\nPython 3.8+\nPython Standard Library (shutil, os, datetime, etc.)\nThird-party libraries (requests, openpyxl, schedule)\nText editor or IDE (Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, etc.)\n\nRelevant Links\n\nPython Official Website\nRequests Library\nOpenPyXL\nSchedule Library\n\n2. Technical Background\nCore Concepts and Terminology\n\nScripting: Writing programs that automate sequences of tasks.\nModules/Libraries: Pre-written code that provides specific functionalities (e.g., file handling, network requests).\nFile Operations: Reading, writing, copying, moving, and deleting files.\nSystem Operations: Interacting with the operating system (e.g., running shell commands, checking system status).\nError Handling: Managing unexpected events or errors gracefully.","How It Works Under the Hood\nPython scripts execute bytecode that interacts with the operating system and other programs through libraries. These libraries abstract low-level operations, making it easier to perform tasks such as file manipulation, network requests, and more.\nBest Practices\n\nModular Code: Break down scripts into reusable functions and modules.\nError Handling: Use try-except blocks to handle potential errors.\nLogging: Keep track of script execution for debugging and auditing.\nTesting: Validate scripts with test cases before deploying them in production environments.\n\nCommon Pitfalls\n\nPermission Issues: Ensure scripts have the necessary permissions to access files and resources.\nPath Handling: Be cautious with absolute vs. relative paths.\nDependencies: Manage third-party libraries to avoid version conflicts.\n\n3.

Best Practices and Optimization\nPerformance Considerations\nUse multithreading or multiprocessing for tasks that involve waiting, such as network requests.\n\nimport concurrent.futures\n\ndef fetch_url(url):\n    import requests\n    response = requests.get(url)\n    return response.status_code","def main():\n    urls = [\"http://example.com/page1\", \"http://example.com/page2\", \"http://example.com/page3\"]\n    with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:\n        futures = {executor.submit(fetch_url, url): url for url in urls}\n        for future in concurrent.futures.as_completed(futures):\n            url = futures[future]\n            try:\n                status_code = future.result()\n                print(f\"URL: {url}, Status: {status_code}\")\n            except Exception as e:\n                print(f\"Error fetching {url}: {e}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nSecurity Considerations\n\nAvoid hard-coding sensitive information. Use environment variables or secure configuration files.\n\n\nimport os\n\n# Instead of:\n# api_key = \"your-secret-api-key\"\n\n# Use:\napi_key = os.getenv(\"API_KEY\")\nif not api_key:\n    raise ValueError(\"API_KEY environment variable not set\")\n\nCode Organization Tips\nOrganize your code into a clear directory structure:","Code Organization Tips\nOrganize your code into a clear directory structure:\n\nproject/\n‚îÇ\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/\n‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.py\n‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ utils/\n‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ file_utils.py\n‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ email_utils.py\n‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ data/\n‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ data.xlsx\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ configs/\n‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ config.json\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ logs/\n‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ app.log\n‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt\n\n6.

If you‚Äôre anything like me, you probably find the repetitive tasks of setting up new Python projects a bit‚Ä¶ well, boring. You know the drill: create directories, set up virtual environments, install dependencies, initialize Git ‚Äî it‚Äôs all pretty standard, but it takes time. So, I decided to automate the whole process to free up more time for actual coding. And trust me, it‚Äôs a game changer.This post isn‚Äôt a one-size-fits-all solution or some grand tutorial. It‚Äôs just me sharing how I automated my Python project setup with a couple of batch scripts, create_project.bat and setup_git.bat, and how it made my life a whole lot easier. My hope is that it inspires you to automate your own workflows","it made my life a whole lot easier. My hope is that it inspires you to automate your own workflows and save yourself from the grunt work too!My Time-Saving SidekickI built the create_project.bat script to handle all the tedious stuff: setting up folders, creating virtual environments, installing the right libraries, and even initializing Git. It‚Äôs like having a personal assistant for project setup.What It Does for Me:Project Types: I usually switch between basic Python projects and AI projects, so I added an option to support both.Optional Streamlit Integration: Sometimes I need to build quick web apps, and Streamlit‚Äôs my go-to, so I added an option to install it during setup.Virtual Environment: No more manual activation ‚Äî this script takes care of that.Automatic Dependency Installation: Based on the project type, it installs the essential libraries like numpy or tensorflow.Git Setup: It even calls another script to initialize my Git repository and push to GitHub. Easy!The Script in","It even calls another script to initialize my Git repository and push to GitHub. Easy!The Script in Action:Choosing My Project Typeif \"%1\"==\"\" (  echo Usage: %0 [base|ai] project_name  exit /b 1)I love that I can quickly switch between a base or AI project by just typing a command.2. Creating the Structuremkdir %PROJECT_NAME%cd %PROJECT_NAME%mkdir src testsIt whips up the folder structure for me, saving time and ensuring consistency.3. README and .gitignoreecho # %PROJECT_NAME% > README.mdecho myenv/ > .gitignoreA README with instructions and a .gitignore file, all without lifting a finger.4. Virtual Environment Setuppython -m venv myenvcall myenv\\Scripts\\activateIt creates and activates the virtual environment right then and there ‚Äî one less thing for me to worry about.5. Handling Dependenciesif \"%PROJECT_TYPE%\"==\"ai\" (  echo tensorflow > ai_requirements.txt) else (  echo numpy > base_requirements.txt)pip install -r %REQUIREMENTS_FILE%Based on whether I‚Äôm working on AI or a regular","install -r %REQUIREMENTS_FILE%Based on whether I‚Äôm working on AI or a regular project, the right libraries are installed.6. Optional Streamlit Setupif /I \"%STREAMLIT_REQ%\"==\"y\" (  pip install streamlit)Sometimes I need Streamlit for building web apps, and I love that I can just type ‚Äúy‚Äù to get it installed.7. Git Setupcall setup_git.bat %PROJECT_NAME%The script calls another script to initialize my Git repo and push everything to GitHub. It‚Äôs a beautiful thing.How I Handle GitI also got tired of manually setting up Git every time, so I built the setup_git.bat script to automate that part too. It asks for my GitHub repo URL, initializes the Git repository, commits everything, and pushes it.Why It‚Äôs a Lifesaver:Git Initialization: No need to type git init anymore.Connect to GitHub: Just give it the GitHub URL and the script handles the rest.First Commit and Push: It stages and pushes everything to my repo with a single command.The Nitty-GrittyRepo URL Promptset /p GITHUB_URL=\"Enter your","to my repo with a single command.The Nitty-GrittyRepo URL Promptset /p GITHUB_URL=\"Enter your GitHub repository URL: \"I just enter the GitHub repo URL, and the script does its thing.2. Git Init and Commitgit initgit add .git commit -m \"Initial commit\"No more forgetting to commit files or manually adding them.3. Push to GitHubgit remote add origin %GITHUB_URL_FULL%git push -u origin masterAnd just like that, my project is live on GitHub.Why I‚Äôm Loving This ApproachIt‚Äôs simple. Automating these tasks saves me tons of time. I don‚Äôt have to think about all the little things like creating folders, setting up environments, or connecting to GitHub. It‚Äôs all done in one go, and it feels like I‚Äôve got a head start on every project. Plus, there‚Äôs something satisfying about watching everything come together in a few seconds.What‚Äôs Next?For me, automation is an ongoing process. While these scripts cover a lot, there‚Äôs always more to streamline. Here are some things I‚Äôm thinking about adding","cover a lot, there‚Äôs always more to streamline. Here are some things I‚Äôm thinking about adding next:More Project Types: I want to expand the script to handle Django, Flask, and even data science projects.Interactive Prompts: I‚Äôm toying with the idea of a more interactive setup where I can pick and choose features as I go.Testing Setup: Maybe I‚Äôll automate setting up pytest or unittest as well.CI/CD Integration: Integrating with GitHub Actions or other CI/CD tools could make deployments smoother.Wrapping UpThis approach to automating my Python project setup has been a total game changer. It‚Äôs not about having a universal solution ‚Äî it‚Äôs about finding what works for me and making my life easier. If you‚Äôre finding your own workflows bogged down with repetitive tasks, maybe this can inspire you to start automating too.Remember, automation isn‚Äôt about perfection; it‚Äôs about freeing up time for the stuff that really matters ‚Äî like writing awesome code. I hope this little glimpse into my","for the stuff that really matters ‚Äî like writing awesome code.

v2.10 with React, there could be several potential causes. Let‚Äôs troubleshoot the issue step-by-step.\nCommon Issues and Troubleshooting Steps\n1. Incorrect Version Installation\nEnsure that you‚Äôre explicitly installing Chakra UI v2.10 and the correct versions of its dependencies. If you‚Äôre using npm or yarn, double-check that you‚Äôre specifying @chakra-ui/[email¬†protected].\n\nFor npm:\n\nbash\nCopy code\nnpm install @chakra-ui/[email¬†protected] @emotion/react @emotion/styled framer-motion\n\n\nFor yarn:\n\nbash\nCopy code\nyarn add @chakra-ui/[email¬†protected] @emotion/react @emotion/styled framer-motion\n\n2. Compatibility Issues with React or Other Dependencies\nChakra UI v2.10 might have compatibility issues with specific versions of React or other dependencies in your project. Check the following:","Chakra UI 2.x requires React 17 or later.\nEnsure that your other dependencies, especially Emotion and Framer Motion, are compatible with Chakra UI v2.10.\n\nTo check your versions:\n\nCheck your package.json for React and Chakra UI version numbers.\nRun the following commands to check the installed versions:\n\nbash\nCopy code\nnpm list react\nnpm list @chakra-ui/react\n\nor if you‚Äôre using yarn:\nbash\nCopy code\nyarn list react\nyarn list @chakra-ui/react\n\nIf React is older than v17, you might need to upgrade it:\nbash\nCopy code\nnpm install react@latest react-dom@latest\n\n3. Peer Dependency Warnings\nWhen you install Chakra UI, you might see peer dependency warnings for @emotion/react, @emotion/styled, or framer-motion. Make sure to install the versions of these libraries that are compatible with Chakra UI v2.10.\n\nChakra UI v2.10 requires @emotion/react, @emotion/styled, and framer-motion. You can install specific versions by running the following:","bash\nCopy code\nnpm install @emotion/react@latest @emotion/styled@latest framer-motion@latest\n\n4. Clear Cache and Reinstall Dependencies\nSometimes, issues may arise from cached files or partial installs. Try clearing your npm/yarn cache and reinstalling the dependencies.\nFor npm:\nbash\nCopy code\nnpm cache clean --force\nrm -rf node_modules\nrm package-lock.json\nnpm install\n\nFor yarn:\nbash\nCopy code\nyarn cache clean\nrm -rf node_modules\nrm yarn.lock\nyarn install\n\n5. Check for Errors in the Console\nAfter running npm install or yarn install, check the terminal for any errors or warnings. These can often provide clues about what‚Äôs going wrong.\nIf you see any specific error messages, feel free to share them with me, and I can help you resolve them.\n6. Ensure Proper Imports in Your Files\nMake sure you‚Äôre importing Chakra UI components correctly in your files. Chakra UI components are imported from @chakra-ui/react. For example:\njsx\nCopy code\nimport { Button, Box, Text } from '@chakra-ui/react';","7. Issues Related to ChakraProvider Setup\nAfter installing Chakra UI, you must wrap your application in the ChakraProvider component to apply Chakra‚Äôs global styles.\nEnsure that you have set up your index.js or main.js file correctly:\njsx\nCopy code\nimport React from 'react';\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom';\nimport { ChakraProvider } from '@chakra-ui/react';\nimport App from './App';\nimport './index.css';\n\nReactDOM.render(\n  <React.StrictMode>\n    <ChakraProvider>\n      <App />\n    </ChakraProvider>\n  </React.StrictMode>,\n  document.getElementById('root')\n);","If you forget to wrap your app in the ChakraProvider, Chakra UI components will not be styled as expected.\n8. React Strict Mode Issues\nIn rare cases, issues with React Strict Mode can cause unexpected behaviors with certain libraries. If you‚Äôre running into errors, try disabling Strict Mode temporarily in your index.js:\njsx\nCopy code\nReactDOM.render(\n  <ChakraProvider>\n    <App />\n  </ChakraProvider>,\n  document.getElementById('root')\n);\n\nIf this fixes the issue, you may need to identify the specific package or feature causing the issue when running React in Strict Mode.\n\n\n\n\n2 Likes\n\n\n\n\n\nYannick\n\n\n\n                    November 19, 2024,  6:09pm\n                  \n\n3\n\n\n\nThank You, let me give it a try and see.\nYou created the vite using vite @4.1.0, same as the coding lesson or the latest version of vite ?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYannick\n\n\n\n                    November 19, 2024,  6:32pm\n                  \n\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Oussama170:","November 19, 2024,  6:32pm\n                  \n\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Oussama170:\n\nnpm install @chakra-ui/[email¬†protected] @emotion/react @emotion/styled framer-motion\n\n\nIt worked from the first step, it was the version of Chakra that was making it hard.\nThank you for the help\n\n\n\n\n1 Like\n\n\n\n\n\n    Related topics\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nTopic\n\nReplies\nViews\nActivity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstalling Chakra UI\n\n\n\n\n\nReact\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n330\n\n\n              October 28, 2024\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nReact Typescript Project...

to Next.js, a React framework that‚Äôs gaining widespread popularity among web developers. Next.js simplifies the process of building React applications by providing a robust set of features like server-side rendering, and static site generation.This makes it an excellent choice for creating fast, scalable, and SEO-friendly web applications!In this tutorial, we‚Äôre going to harness the power of Next.js to build a static landing page. Our goal is to create a simple landing page with a navigation menu and a few different pages.This tutorial is designed for beginners, but even if you‚Äôre an experienced developer, you might find some useful refreshers along the way.Setup and Project StructurePhoto by Mohammad Rahmani on UnsplashFirst things first,","along the way.Setup and Project StructurePhoto by Mohammad Rahmani on UnsplashFirst things first, let‚Äôs set up a new Next.js project. If you‚Äôre new to Next.js, don‚Äôt worry ‚Äî the setup process is straightforward. Here‚Äôs how you do it:Part 1: Basic SetupInstall Node.js: Before we begin, ensure you have Node.js installed on your system. This is essential as Next.js runs on Node.js. You can download and install it from the official Node.js website.Create a Next.js App: Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:npx create-next-app my-landing-pageFeel free to replace ‚Äòmy-landing-page‚Äô with whatever name you wish to give your project. This command creates a new folder named after your project and installs all of the necessary dependencies for the initial application.This tutorial uses JavaScript , but feel free to follow along in typescript!Part 2: Look Around!Explore the File Structure: After the installation process is complete, navigate to your project folder and","the File Structure: After the installation process is complete, navigate to your project folder and open it in your favorite code editor. You‚Äôll notice several directories and files:app: Replaces the traditional pages directory in Next.js 13, offering a more organized way to structure pages and components.public: This directory is for static files like images, fonts, or any other files that need to be served unchanged.styles: Here, you can add your CSS files. Next.js supports various styling options.By default, Next.js comes with some pre-configured files and folders. This setup helps in getting projects off the ground quickly.Part 3: Creating The Project StructureNow that we have our Next.js app set up, let‚Äôs structure it for our static landing page.Creating Basic Pages:Our project currently has a default index.js page in the pages directory. This will serve as our Home page.For additional pages like About and Contact, create directories and files within app (e.g., app/about/page.js","pages like About and Contact, create directories and files within app (e.g., app/about/page.js and app/contact/page.js).In about.js and contact.js, add a basic functional component. For example, in about.js, you can start with something like this:export default function About() {  return <div>About us</div>;}Do the same for contact.js, replacing About with Contact. This will give us a basic structure to work with.Understanding the Page System:Each page.js file under the app directory represents a route. For example, app/about/page.js becomes accessible at /about.This system simplifies routing, removing the need for manual route configuration.At this point, you have a Next.js application with a basic structure. You can run npm run dev in your terminal, and your app will be up and running at http://localhost:3000. You'll be able to navigate to /about and /contact, seeing the respective text rendered on the page.In the next section, we‚Äôll dive into creating a consistent layout for our","text rendered on the page.In the next section, we‚Äôll dive into creating a consistent layout for our application, including a navigation menu and footer, and then implement basic routing to link our pages together.Designing the LayoutPhoto by Hal Gatewood on UnsplashA well-structured layout is crucial for any website. It ensures a consistent look and feel across different pages. In Next.js, we achieve this by creating a Layout component. Let's build one!Setting Up the Layout Component:In your project directory, create a new folder named components.Inside the components folder, create a file named Layout.js.Now, let‚Äôs write the Layout component. Add the following code to Layout.js:export default function Layout({ children }) {  return (    <div>      <header>        {/* Navigation links will go here */}      </header>      <main>{children}</main>      <footer>        {/* Footer content */}      </footer>    </div>  );}This component takes children as a prop and renders them between the","</footer>    </div>  );}This component takes children as a prop and renders them between the header and footer.Implementing the Layout in Pages:With our Layout component ready, let's incorporate it into our pages.Using Layout in Index PageOpen pages/index.js.Import the Layout component at the top of the file:import Layout from '../components/Layout';Wrap the existing content of index.js inside the Layout component:export default function Home() {  return (    <Layout>      <h1>Welcome to Our Landing Page</h1>      {/* More content can be added here */}    </Layout>  );}This will render the homepage content within the common layout, ensuring consistency across the site.Repeating for Other PagesFollow the same steps for about.js and contact.js. Import and wrap the content in the Layout component.This ensures that all your pages have a consistent header and footer.Basic RoutingPhoto by Firmbee.com on UnsplashNext.js simplifies routing with its file-system-based router. Let‚Äôs set up","Firmbee.com on UnsplashNext.js simplifies routing with its file-system-based router. Let‚Äôs set up navigation for our site.Adding Navigation LinksIn your Layout.js, let's add some navigation links. First, import Link from next/link at the top of the file.Update the header section with navigation links:import Link from 'next/link';// Inside your Layout component<header>  <nav>    <Link href=\"/\"><a>Home</a></Link>    <Link href=\"/about\"><a>About</a></Link>    <Link href=\"/contact\"><a>Contact</a></Link>  </nav></header>These Link components enable client-side navigation between your pages without a full page reload, making the experience faster and smoother.Understanding Next.js Navigation:The Link component from Next.js pre-fetches the linked pages, resulting in a near-instantaneous navigation experience.Unlike traditional anchor tags (<a>), Link doesn't cause a browser refresh.Wrapping Up the Layout and RoutingAt this point, we have a functional layout with a navigation header and a","Up the Layout and RoutingAt this point, we have a functional layout with a navigation header and a footer, used consistently across our pages. We‚Äôve also implemented basic routing, enabling easy navigation through the site. This setup forms the backbone of most Next.js applications, providing a scalable and maintainable structure.Next, we‚Äôll explore adding dynamic elements and interactivity to our landing page, further enhancing its functionality and user experience.Adding Dynamic Elements and InteractivityPhoto by Jotform on UnsplashA static landing page can be more engaging with dynamic content and interactive elements. Let‚Äôs explore how to add these features in Next.js.Creating a Contact Form ComponentIn the components folder, create a new file named ContactForm.js.Add a simple contact form structure with name, email, and message fields:export default function ContactForm() {  return (    <form>      <input type=\"text\" placeholder=\"Your Name\" />      <input type=\"email\"","{  return (    <form>      <input type=\"text\" placeholder=\"Your Name\" />      <input type=\"email\" placeholder=\"Your Email\" />      <textarea placeholder=\"Your Message\"></textarea>      <button type=\"submit\">Send</button>    </form>  );}This form doesn‚Äôt need to be functional yet; we‚Äôre focusing on structure and layout.Adding the Form to the Contact PageImport ContactForm into contact.js and include it in the page layout:import Layout from '../components/Layout';import ContactForm from '../components/ContactForm';export default function Contact() {  return (    <Layout>      <h1>Contact Us</h1>      <ContactForm />    </Layout>  );}Implementing a Simple JavaScript Interaction:Let‚Äôs add a basic JavaScript interaction to our homepage. For example, a button that toggles additional content.In index.js, add a button and some state to manage its visibility:import { useState } from 'react';import Layout from '../components/Layout';export default function Home() {  const [showMore,","Layout from '../components/Layout';export default function Home() {  const [showMore, setShowMore] = useState(false);  return (    <Layout>      <h1>Welcome to Our Landing Page</h1>      <button onClick={() => setShowMore(!showMore)}>        {showMore ? 'Show Less' : 'Show More'}      </button>      {showMore && <p>Here is some more content!</p>}    </Layout>  );}ConclusionPhoto by Rahul Mishra on UnsplashCongratulations! You‚Äôve now built a basic static landing page with Next.js, complete with a consistent layout, basic routing, and some dynamic, interactive elements. This foundation sets the stage for more complex features and functionalities, like API routes, styling, authentication, and more!NextjsWeb DevelopmentCodingTutorialDevelopment----FollowWritten by Mansour N2 Followers¬∑1 FollowingFollowNo responses yetHelpStatusAboutCareersPressBlogPrivacyRulesTermsText to speech"],"metadata":[{"description":"Welcome to Next.js, a React framework that‚Äôs gaining widespread popularity among web developers.

Tokens.  colors: {    text: \"#111\",    primary: \"#06f\",  },  fonts: {    body: \"system-ui, sans-serif\",    heading: \"system-ui,","\"#111\",    primary: \"#06f\",  },  fonts: {    body: \"system-ui, sans-serif\",    heading: \"system-ui, sans-serif\",  },  fontWeights: {    body: 400,    heading: 700,    bold: 700,  },","// 2.

You reference tokens using the token name and you can mix in any CSS properties.<section display=\"grid\" col=\"2\" py=\"10\">  <div>    <h1 variant=\"heading.h1\" color=\"primary\">{title}</h1>    <p variant=\"text.lead\">{text}</p>    <button bg=\"primary\" py=\"2\" px=\"4\" mt=\"4>Learn more</button>  </div>  <img src={image} alt=\"Alt text\" /></section> CopyCopyCreate a new projectCreate a new Next.js site using the nextjs-starter-typescript.npx create-next-app reflexjs-example -e https://github.com/reflexjs/nextjs-starter-typescript CopyCopyStart the development server:cd reflexjs-example CopyCopyyarn dev CopyCopyIf you open http://localhost:3000 in your browser, you should see the default landing page.Take a quick look at pages/index.tsx to see how this page is built.Directory StructureThe starter directory structure is intended to provide a great starting point for building your site.However, Reflexjs imposes","is intended to provide a great starting point for building your site.However, Reflexjs imposes no restrictions on how you organize your files.reflexjs-example  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pages  ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ index.tsx  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ public  ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ images  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ src      ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ theme.ts CopyCopyAdd a pageTo add a new page, create the file: pages/about.tsx with the following code:pages/about.tsxexport default function AboutPage() {  return <p>This is the about page</p>} CopyCopyNow open http://localhost:3000/about to see your new page.That's it.

For projects in the demos/ directory, you need to manually cd them and run pnpm install to install the dependencies.\nSo I configured the pnpm-workspace.yaml file as follows:\npackages:\n- \"packages/*\"\n\nHowever, when I cd into demos/projct-a and run pnpm install, I find that pnpm only updates the dependencies in the packages/ directory, and the dependency installation in project demos/project-a is completely ignored:\nroot@mac projct-a % pnpm install","Scope: all 5 workspace projects\nDone in 457ms\n\nI saw the article, but I can't use pnpm --ignore-workspace install because this project imports packages in packages/* by workspace.\n\n\n\n\npnpm-workspace\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\nImprove this question\n\n\n\n                        Follow\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            asked Apr 9 at 11:14\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhopgoldyhopgoldy\n\n9522 silver badges88 bronze badges\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd a comment\n¬†|¬†\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated questions\n\n\n\n\n                                3\n                            \n\nHow to trigger packages to build automatically when using pnpm install?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                3\n                            \n\nHow to run pnpm on a nested folder that is _not_ part of workspace setup?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                2\n                            \n\nEfficiently Managing Shared Dependencies and Binaries in a pnpm Monorepo Workspace\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated questions\n\n\n\n\n                                3","Related questions\n\n\n\n\n                                3\n                            \n\nHow to trigger packages to build automatically when using pnpm install?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                3\n                            \n\nHow to run pnpm on a nested folder that is _not_ part of workspace setup?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                2\n                            \n\nEfficiently Managing Shared Dependencies and Binaries in a pnpm Monorepo Workspace\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                0\n                            \n\nPnpm workspace config to publish pakcages under a specific directory only\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                2\n                            \n\npnpm node-linker in workspace\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                4\n                            \n\npnpm monorepo: how to set up a simple reusable (vue) component for reuse?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                0","0\n                            \n\nWhy is the node_modules link for my pnpm workspace sometimes the local package's root and sometime its dist folder?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                8\n                            \n\nPublish NPM package that uses a workspaces as dependencies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Load 5 more related questions\n                \n\n Show fewer related questions\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Sorted by:\n        \n\n            Reset to default\n        \n\n\n\n\n                        Highest score (default)\n                    \n\n                        Trending (recent votes count more)\n                    \n\n                        Date modified (newest first)\n                    \n\n                        Date created (oldest first)\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKnow someone who can answer?

Starting from version 7, pnpm supports auto-installing peer dependencies. Here's a guide to enabling this feature and ensuring a smooth development workflow.Why Auto-Install Peer Dependencies?Peer dependencies are essential for ensuring compatibility between packages. By enabling automatic installation, you can:Reduce manual dependency management.Avoid build errors caused by missing peer dependencies.Ensure consistency across development environments.How to Enable Auto-Installation of Peer DependenciesThere are two main ways to enable the auto-installation of peer dependencies in pnpm: using the .npmrc file or setting the","to enable the auto-installation of peer dependencies in pnpm: using the .npmrc file or setting the configuration via command line.Method 1: Configure .npmrcCreate or modify the .npmrc file in the root directory of your project, and add the following line:auto-install-peers=true","This ensures that all developers working on the project will have the same configuration.Method 2: Use the Command LineRun the following command to enable the auto-installation globally or locally:Globally:pnpm config set auto-install-peers true\nThis sets the configuration for all projects on your machine.Locally (per project):pnpm config set auto-install-peers true --location project\nThis creates or updates the .npmrc file in your project's root directory.Steps to Apply the ChangesAfter enabling auto-installation, follow these steps to ensure everything is properly set up:Remove Existing node_modulesrm -rf node_modules\nReinstall Dependencies Run the installation command to apply the configuration:pnpm install\nOptionally Use --shamefully-hoist If you encounter issues with peer dependencies, you can use the --shamefully-hoist flag:pnpm install --shamefully-hoist","FAQsWhat is the .npmrc file?The .npmrc file is a configuration file used by npm and pnpm to manage settings such as registries, authentication tokens, and behavior like auto-installing peer dependencies.Does enabling auto-install-peers modify my package.json?No, enabling auto-install-peers does not add peer dependencies to your package.json. It ensures they are installed in node_modules during the install process.How do I disable auto-installation of peer dependencies?To disable the feature, you can either delete the corresponding line from .npmrc or run:pnpm config delete auto-install-peers","Best PracticesCommit the .npmrc file: Ensure all developers working on the project have consistent behavior.Review peer dependencies: Use the auto-install-peers feature judiciously to maintain clarity on what dependencies your project explicitly uses.Stay Updated: Use the latest version of pnpm to benefit from improved peer dependency handling.ConclusionBy enabling the auto-installation of peer dependencies in pnpm, you can simplify your workflow and avoid potential issues caused by missing dependencies. Whether through a .npmrc file or command-line configuration, this feature ensures a smoother development experience for your team.Previous ArticleDifference Between pnpm create, pnpx, and dlxNext ArticleHow to fix the common pnpm error: Unable to find the global bin directory.‚Üê Back to the blogRipal & Zalak ‚Ä¢ ¬© 2025 ‚Ä¢ True Coder Guru"],"metadata":[{"description":"Learn how to configure pnpm to automatically install peer dependencies for streamlined project management.","embedding_config":"{\"engine\": \"\", \"model\": \"sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2\"}","language":"en-us","source":"https://truecoderguru.com/blog/pnpm/pnpm-auto-install-peer-dependencies","start_index":0,"title":"Auto-Installing Peer Dependencies in pnpm | True Coder Guru"},{"description":"Learn how to configure pnpm to automatically install peer dependencies for streamlined project management.","embedding_config":"{\"engine\": \"\", \"model\": \"sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2\"}","language":"en-us","source":"https://truecoderguru.com/blog/pnpm/pnpm-auto-install-peer-dependencies","start_index":898,"title":"Auto-Installing Peer Dependencies in pnpm | True Coder Guru"},{"description":"Learn how to configure pnpm to automatically install peer dependencies for streamlined project management.","embedding_config":"{\"engine\": \"\", \"model\": \"sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2\"}","language":"en-us","source":"https://truecoderguru.com/blog/pnpm/pnpm-auto-install-peer-dependencies","start_index":1177,"title":"Auto-Installing Peer Dependencies in pnpm | True Coder Guru"},{"description":"Learn how to configure pnpm to automatically install peer dependencies for streamlined project management.","embedding_config":"{\"engine\": \"\", \"model\": \"sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2\"}","language":"en-us","source":"https://truecoderguru.com/blog/pnpm/pnpm-auto-install-peer-dependencies","start_index":2051,"title":"Auto-Installing Peer Dependencies in pnpm | True Coder Guru"},{"description":"Learn how to configure pnpm to automatically install peer dependencies for streamlined project management.","embedding_config":"{\"engine\": \"\", \"model\": \"sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2\"}","language":"en-us","source":"https://truecoderguru.com/blog/pnpm/pnpm-auto-install-peer-dependencies","start_index":2650,"title":"Auto-Installing Peer Dependencies in pnpm | True Coder Guru"}]},{"source":{"collection_name":"web-search-19d560eeb16ea7bfc9595957e0aa7eaf15478addb700bdcf77c3","name":"Automating installation of required dev dependencies via pnpm","type":"web_search","urls":["https://pnpm.io/cli/add"]},"document":["pnpm add <pkg> | pnpm","Skip to main contentpnpmDocsBlogFAQBenchmarksCommunityMoreBlogFAQCommunityBenchmarks10.xNext10.x9.x8.xEnglishEnglishItaliano (61%)ÁÆÄ‰Ωì‰∏≠Êñá (99%)Êó•Êú¨Ë™û (86%)ÌïúÍµ≠Ïñ¥ (52%)Portugu√™s Brasileiro (61%)Ê≠£È´î‰∏≠Êñá (43%)–†—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–π (38%)–£–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω—Å—å–∫–∞ (80%)Fran√ßais (50%)T√ºrk√ße (28%)Espa√±ol (67%)Bahasa Indonesia (32%)Help Us Translateüß° Sponsor UsOpen CollectiveGitHub SponsorsCrypto DonationsSearchIntroductionUsageCLI commandsManage dependenciespnpm add <pkg>pnpm installpnpm updatepnpm removepnpm linkpnpm unlinkpnpm importpnpm rebuildpnpm prunepnpm fetchpnpm install-testpnpm dedupePatch dependenciesReview dependenciesRun scriptsManage environmentsInspect the storeManage cacheMisc.ConfigurationFeaturesRecipesAdvancedCLI commandsManage dependenciespnpm add <pkg>Version: 10.xOn this pagepnpm add <pkg>Installs a package and any packages that it depends on.\nBy default, any new package is installed as a production dependency.\nTL;DR‚Äã","By default, any new package is installed as a production dependency.\nTL;DR‚Äã\nCommandMeaningpnpm add saxSave to dependenciespnpm add -D saxSave to devDependenciespnpm add -O saxSave to optionalDependenciespnpm add -g sax Install package globallypnpm add sax@nextInstall from the next tagpnpm add sax@3.0.0Specify version 3.0.0\nSupported package locations‚Äã\nInstall from npm registry‚Äã\npnpm add package-name will install the latest version of package-name from\nthe npm registry by default.\nIf executed in a workspace, the command will first try to check whether other\nprojects in the workspace use the specified package.

It offers a collection of pre-styled components and design tokens, streamlining the development process.Next.JS is a JavaScript framework for building React-based web applications. It allows React components to be rendered on the server side ‚Äî by generating HTML content from the server side which helps improve performance and search engine optimization (SEO).To get started, first create your Next.JS project on your local machine.Step 1: Create a New Next.js ProjectCreating a new Next.js project. Open your terminal and run the following command:npx","Next.js ProjectCreating a new Next.js project. Open your terminal and run the following command:npx create-next-app@latest next-with-chakraA Next.js project directory called ` next-with-chakra ` is created. Enter this directory using ‚Äî `cd next-with-chakra`.Step 2: Install Chakra UI using the commandnpm i @chakra-ui/react @emotion/react @emotion/styled framer-motionAfter installing Chakra UI, you need to set up the ChakraProvider at the root of your application. This can be either in your index.jsx, index.tsx, or App.jsx depending on the framework you use.Using Next.Js navigate to your pages folder and execute step 3 as seen below.Step 3: Write the following code in your _app.js file:import * as React from 'react'// 1. import `ChakraProvider` componentimport { ChakraProvider } from '@chakra-ui/react'function App({Component, pageProps}) {  // 2. Wrap ChakraProvider at the root of your app  return (    <ChakraProvider>      <Component {...pageProps} />    </ChakraProvider>  );}export","app  return (    <ChakraProvider>      <Component {...pageProps} />    </ChakraProvider>  );}export default AppThe ChakraProvider component initializes chakra in your web application.Step 4: Start DevelopmentThe whole setup is complete and Chakra UI is successfully installed, run the command:npm run devOne of the interesting features of Chakra-UI is, that styles used in creating your user interfaces are present as React components, so all you need to do is; import a certain component you need and it is ready for use.In this article, you will see a few steps taken to create certain landing page sections using Chakra-UI with next.js.Navigation bar. When trying to stack your items in a nav bar horizontally one component can be really efficient this is the ‚ÄòHStack‚Äô component. The HStack or Horizontal stack component works in some ways like the CSS flexbox. Especially, in displaying items horizontally. The link components are used to create links that will navigate users to certain pages","The link components are used to create links that will navigate users to certain pages like the following:HomeAbout UsContactFAQimport React from \"react\";import {Heading, HStack, Spacer, Link, Flex, Button, Box} from \"@chakra-ui/react\";import NextLink from \"next/link\";      <Flex alignItems=\"center\">        <Heading as=\"h1\" size=\"lg\" color=\"#007BFF\" ml=\"20px\">          Navbar        </Heading>        <Spacer />        <HStack>          <Link color=\"#000\" as={NextLink} href=\"#\"> Home</Link>          <Link color=\"#000\" as={NextLink} href=\"#\">Services</Link>          <Link color=\"#000\" as={NextLink} href=\"#\">About Us</Link>          <Link color=\"#000\" as={NextLink} href=\"#\">Contact Us</Link>          <Link color=\"#000\" as={NextLink} href=\"#\">FAQ</Link>          <Button ml=\"100px\" bg=\"#FFF\" border=\"1px solid\" color=\"#007BFF\"  mt=\"10px\">Button</Button>          <Button ml=\"15px\" bg=\"#007BFF\" color=\"#FFF\" mt=\"10px\" mr=\"20px\">Button</Button>        </HStack>      </Flex>by authorCardIf a","color=\"#FFF\" mt=\"10px\" mr=\"20px\">Button</Button>        </HStack>      </Flex>by authorCardIf a section contains a card with a body, header, and footer. You can arrange the elements inside the card with the Chakra UI card component. By importing the card component and its child components such as the:CardBodyCardHeaderCardFooter.If necessary. To create a button inside the card. Import the button component. The button is created with Chakra generic styles, which can be tweaked to suit your wants.import React from \"react\";import {Heading, HStack, Spacer, Flex, Button, Card, CardBody, CardHeader, Stack} from \"@chakra-ui/react\";import NextLink from \"next/link\";      <Flex alignItems=\"center\">        <Text m=\"20px\">          Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit.

Icons with shaped backgrounds with colors are quite fun to create, Chakra has component icons that are very efficient, there is no need to import a third-party icon module. Import the shape component, inside the shape component use the icon components for each of the social media icons, Like so:import React from \"react\";import {HStack, Text, Link, Grid, GridItem, Circle, List, ListItem} from \"@chakra-ui/react\";import NextLink from \"next/link\";import { PhoneIcon } from \"@chakra-ui/icons\";import { EmailIcon } from \"@chakra-ui/icons\";      <Grid templateColumns=\"repeat(8, auto)\" mt=\"50px\">        <GridItem ml=\"20px\" colSpan=\"1\">          <Text fontSize=\"20px\" fontWeight=\"400px\">            Chakra-UI          </Text>          <List>             <Link as={NextLink} href=\"#\">","Chakra-UI          </Text>          <List>             <Link as={NextLink} href=\"#\">              <ListItem>Icons</ListItem>            </Link>            <Link as={NextLink} href=\"#\">              <ListItem>Components</ListItem>            </Link>            <Link as={NextLink} href=\"#\">              <ListItem>Styles</ListItem>            </Link>          </List>        </GridItem>        <GridItem colSpan=\"1\">          <Text fontSize=\"20px\" fontWeight=\"400px\">            Chakra-UI          </Text>          <List>            <Link as={NextLink} href=\"#\">              <ListItem>Icons</ListItem>            </Link>            <Link as={NextLink} href=\"#\">              <ListItem>Components</ListItem>            </Link>            <Link as={NextLink} href=\"#\">              <ListItem>Styles</ListItem>            </Link>          </List>        </GridItem>        <GridItem colSpan=\"1\">          <Text fontSize=\"20px\" fontWeight=\"400px\">            Chakra-UI          </Text>","<Text fontSize=\"20px\" fontWeight=\"400px\">            Chakra-UI          </Text>          <List>            <Link as={NextLink} href=\"#\">              <ListItem>Icons</ListItem>            </Link>            <Link as={NextLink} href=\"#\">              <ListItem>Components</ListItem>            </Link>            <Link as={NextLink} href=\"#\">              <ListItem>Styles</ListItem>            </Link>          </List>        </GridItem>        <GridItem colSpan=\"1\">          <Text fontSize=\"20px\" fontWeight=\"400px\">            Icon Media          </Text>          <Text>Avoid missing out, follow!</Text>          <HStack>            <Link as={NextLink} href=\"#\">              <Circle size=\"40px\" bg=\"#007BFF\" color=\"#FFF\">                <EmailIcon />              </Circle>            </Link>            <Link as={NextLink} href=\"#\">              <Circle size=\"40px\" bg=\"#007BFF\" color=\"#FFF\">                <PhoneIcon />              </Circle>            </Link>          </HStack>","<PhoneIcon />              </Circle>            </Link>          </HStack>        </GridItem>      </Grid>by authorConclusionIn summary, we have demonstrated how you can use Chakra UI inside your nextjs project to create sections like a navbar using the HStack component and the link component, a card with a header, body, and button using the card component, and creating a footer with Chakra UI icons and we have seen how effective the flex and grid components work in Chakra UI.Chakra UI is a powerful tool for creating visually appealing and accessible web applications.

This article will be focused on the problems I‚Äôve encountered and how I solved them.To begin with, I recommend that you read the information on the Storybook configuration from the official website to have a basic understanding.Configuration filesThe configuration","from the official website to have a basic understanding.Configuration filesThe configuration files are located in your project root fold .storybook, and the most important ones are main.js preview.js manager.js The main config file is main.js, there is a chance that you don‚Äôt need to config other files. This article will put more value on main.js and preview.jsmain.jsAs it is clearly stated in Storybook documentation:The main.js configuration file is a preset and as such has a powerful interface, but the key fields within it are:1. stories- an array of globs that indicates the location of your story files, relative to main.js.2. addons - a list of the addons you are using.3. webpackFinal - custom webpack configuration.4. babel - custom babel configuration.module.exports = {// The location of your stories  stories: ['../src/**/*.stories.@(js|mdx)'],// addons added to your storybook  addons: ['@storybook/addon-essentials'],// custom babel config    babel: async (options) => ({","addons: ['@storybook/addon-essentials'],// custom babel config    babel: async (options) => ({      ...options,      // any extra options you want to set  }),//  custom webpack configwebpackFinal: async (config, { configType }) => {    // `configType` has a value of 'DEVELOPMENT' or 'PRODUCTION'    // You can change the configuration based on that.    // 'PRODUCTION' is used when building the static version of storybook.    // Make whatever fine-grained changes you need    config.module.rules.push({      test: /\\.scss$/,      use: ['style-loader', 'css-loader', 'sass-loader'],      include: path.resolve(__dirname, '../'),    });    // Return the altered config    return config;  }}Tip 1: The Storybook has its default webpack configuration, when trying to import your current webpack config or add your own rules, DO use push to add your rules to the rules array, or mutable the config object.config.module.rules.push({      test: /\\.scss$/,      use: ['style-loader', 'css-loader',","object.config.module.rules.push({      test: /\\.scss$/,      use: ['style-loader', 'css-loader', 'sass-loader'],      include: path.resolve(__dirname, '../'),    });Config the necessary alias that already applies to your current project.config.resolve.alias = {    ...config.resolve.alias,    \"ui-components\": path.resolve(__dirname, \"../src\")};Tip 2: To check the final webpack config, you can run yarn storybook --debug-webpack to print the config in your terminal or you can add console.log(config.module.rules) inside webpackFinal function, and run yarn storybook to print only part of the final webpack config.Tip 3: Since version 6.0, Storybook add essential addons by default, including Docs, Controls, Actions, Viewport, Backgrounds, Toolbars. You can check the release note here.All you need is to add essential addons in config.addons: ['@storybook/addon-essentials']With docs and control addons, Arg Table/Props Table can be addedpreview.jsTo control the way stories are rendered and add","addons, Arg Table/Props Table can be addedpreview.jsTo control the way stories are rendered and add global decorators and parameters, create a .storybook/preview.js file. This is loaded in the Canvas tab, the ‚Äúpreview‚Äù iframe that renders your components in isolation. Use preview.js for global code (such as CSS imports or JavaScript mocks) that applies to all stories.The preview.js file can be an ES module and export the following keys:decorators - an array of global decoratorsparameters - an object of global parametersglobalTypes - definition of globalTypesIf you‚Äôre looking to change how your stories are ordered, read about sorting stories.Tip 4: preview.js is the file where you can also import the global css/sass, so it will apply the styles to your components.import ‚Äú../src/styles/theme.css‚Äù;Tip 5: If you have a top wrapper with a specific class name which has styles, you should add the same wrapper through decorator.import { addDecorator } from \"@storybook/react\";// For each","add the same wrapper through decorator.import { addDecorator } from \"@storybook/react\";// For each story, the parent element will be div with class name \"platform\"addDecorator(story => <div className=\"platform\">{story()}</div>);Tip 6: Any other global config or javascript mocks (formatters etc.) should be added in preview.jsimport { addDecorator } from \"@storybook/react\";import { withI18n } from \"storybook-addon-i18n\";addDecorator(withI18n);manager.jsThe manager.js is to control the behaviour of Storybook‚Äôs UI. You can set UI options and configure Storybook‚Äôs theme. It is optional and no need to add if your project doesn‚Äôt have the requirement for customised Storybook UI/theme.To concludeSince Storybook 6.0, the Storybook team makes it easier to configure, even though some of the config is missing or not written in a very detailed way in the documentation.

It also allows you to define and run scripts to automate various tasks within your project. One can make use of npm packages within your scripts to extend functionality. For instance, you can employ packages like cross-env to set environment variables cross-platform. These scripts are housed in the package.json file, which acts as a central configuration hub for npm-managed projects.\nWhy Choose NPM Scripts for Builds?In summary, npm scripts provide a lightweight yet powerful solution for automating your project builds. By defining simple commands in your package.json file, you can streamline your development workflow and spend more time coding and less time managing build tools.","Simplicity: NPM scripts offer a straightforward approach to building your projects. No need to juggle multiple build tools or configurations.Integration: Since npm scripts are part of the npm ecosystem, they seamlessly integrate with your existing workflow. No extra installations are NPM required!Customization: With npm scripts, you have the flexibility to tailor your build process to suit your project's unique requirements.Steps to create NPM scripts:Let's walk through the process of setting up npm scripts for a basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript project:\nInitialize a new npm project:Begin by initializing a new npm project within your project directory:\nnpm init -yThis command creates a package.json file with default settings.\nDefine your build scripts:For a simple project involving HTML, CSS, and JavaScript(code given below),  you can set up scripts to copy files from the src directory to the dist directory.","Now, let's define the npm script in the package.json file. Open package.json and add the following:\n\"scripts\": {  \"build\": \"mkdir -p dist && cp src/index.html dist/ && cp src/style.css dist/ && cp src/script.js dist/\"}Here, the build script creates a dist directory (if it doesn't exist) and copies the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files from the src directory to the dist directory.\nRun the Project:To run an HTML file with live-server, you can use the live-server package. First, you need to install it globally (if you haven't already) using npm:\nnpm install -g live-serverAfter installing live-server, you can use it to serve your HTML file by navigating to the directory containing your HTML file in your terminal and running:\nlive-serverThis command will start a local server and open your default web browser to display your HTML file. It also provides features like live reloading, so any changes you make to your HTML file","Note: You can also run this project By Right clicking on index.html file by clicking on \"Open with Live Server\"","Run your build script:Execute your build script using the npm run command followed by the script name:\nnpm run buildThis command triggers the defined build tasks, generating a distribution-ready version of your project in the dist directory.\nPackage.json file:\npackage.jsonFolder Structure:\nExample: To demonstrate creating an simple JavaScript project and using the npm script as build tool in it.\n\nHTML\n\n<!-- index.html -->\n\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" \n          content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n    <title>My Project</title>\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"style.css\">\n</head>\n\n<body>\n    <h1>GeeksforGeeks!</h1>\n    <script src=\"script.js\"></script>\n</body>\n\n</html>\n\n\nCSS\n\n/* style.css */\nbody {\n    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\n    background-color: #f0f0f0;\n}\n\nh1 {\n    color: green;\n}\n\n\nJavaScript\n\n//src/script.js\nconsole.log(\"Script loaded!\");\n\nOutput:\noutput","JavaScript\n\n//src/script.js\nconsole.log(\"Script loaded!\");\n\nOutput:\noutput\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n        Comment\r\n    More info\nAdvertise with us\n\n\n\nNext Article\n\n\n\n\nXML Namespaces\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nisandeep2183 \n\n\n\n\n\n Follow \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImprove\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArticle Tags : \n\n\nJavaScript\n\n\nWeb Technologies\n\n\nNode.js\n\n\nNode-npm\n \n\n\n\n\n\nSimilar Reads\n\n\nHow to Run, Configure, and Troubleshoot npm Scripts?\r\n                    \nnpm (Node Package Manager) is not only used for managing dependencies in Node.js projects but also provides a powerful script-running functionality. npm scripts allow you to automate various tasks such as running tests, building your project, deploying applications, and more.

However, as with any programming language, errors and exceptions are an inevitable part of the development process. Effective error handling is crucial for creating robust and reliable Python scripts.\nWhat is Error Handling?\nError handling in Python refers to the process of detecting, managing, and responding to errors that occur during the execution of a script. Errors can arise from a variety of sources, such as incorrect input, invalid data, or logical flaws in the code.\nImportance of Error Handling\nProper error handling is essential for several reasons:","Improved User Experience: By anticipating and handling errors gracefully, you can provide a better user experience by avoiding unexpected program crashes or confusing error messages.\nRobust and Reliable Code: Effective error handling helps ensure that your Python scripts can gracefully handle unexpected situations and continue running, rather than crashing or producing incorrect results.\nDebugging and Troubleshooting: Proper error handling can provide valuable information for debugging and troubleshooting, making it easier to identify and fix issues in your code.\n\nCommon Types of Errors in Python\nPython categorizes errors into two main types:","Common Types of Errors in Python\nPython categorizes errors into two main types:\n\nSyntax Errors: These occur when the Python interpreter encounters code that does not conform to the language's syntax rules. Syntax errors are typically caught and reported during the code execution process.\nExceptions: Exceptions are errors that occur during the execution of a script, such as trying to divide by zero, accessing an index out of range, or opening a file that does not exist. Exceptions can be handled using Python's built-in exception handling mechanisms.","Understanding the different types of errors and their characteristics is the first step towards implementing effective error handling in your Python scripts.\nImplementing Effective Error Handling Techniques\nTry-Except Blocks\nThe foundation of error handling in Python is the try-except block. This structure allows you to enclose a block of code that may raise an exception, and then handle the exception if it occurs.\ntry:\n    ## Code that may raise an exception\n    result = 10 / 0\nexcept ZeroDivisionError:\n    print(\"Error: Division by zero\")\nIn the example above, if a ZeroDivisionError occurs, the code inside the except block will be executed instead of the program crashing.\nHandling Multiple Exceptions\nYou can handle multiple exceptions in a single try-except block by specifying multiple except clauses.\ntry:\n    ## Code that may raise different exceptions\n    result = int(\"abc\")\nexcept ValueError:\n    print(\"Error: Invalid input\")\nexcept TypeError:","result = int(\"abc\")\nexcept ValueError:\n    print(\"Error: Invalid input\")\nexcept TypeError:\n    print(\"Error: Incompatible data types\")\nThis allows you to provide specific error handling for different types of exceptions that may occur.\nRaising Exceptions\nSometimes, you may need to raise your own exceptions to signal that a specific error condition has occurred. You can use the raise statement to do this.\ndef divide(a, b):\n    if b == 0:\n        raise ZeroDivisionError(\"Error: Division by zero\")\n    return a / b","try:\n    result = divide(10, 0)\nexcept ZeroDivisionError as e:\n    print(e)\nThis can be useful when you want to provide more informative error messages or when you need to create custom exception types.\nUsing the finally Clause\nThe finally clause in a try-except block ensures that a block of code is executed regardless of whether an exception was raised or not. This is useful for cleaning up resources, such as closing a file or database connection.\ntry:\n    file = open(\"file.txt\", \"r\")\n    content = file.read()\n    print(content)\nexcept FileNotFoundError:\n    print(\"Error: File not found\")\nfinally:\n    file.close()\nBy including the file closing logic in the finally clause, you can ensure that the file is properly closed even if an exception is raised.\nContextual Error Handling with with Statement","Contextual Error Handling with with Statement\nThe with statement provides a convenient way to handle resources that need to be properly acquired and released, such as file objects or database connections. It automatically takes care of the cleanup process, even in the presence of exceptions.\nwith open(\"file.txt\", \"r\") as file:\n    content = file.read()\n    print(content)\nIn the example above, the file is automatically closed when the with block is exited, regardless of whether an exception occurred or not.\nBy mastering these error handling techniques, you can create more robust and reliable Python scripts that can gracefully handle unexpected situations.\nBest Practices for Error Handling in Python Scripts\nCatch Specific Exceptions\nWhen handling exceptions, it's best to catch specific exception types rather than using a broad except clause. This allows you to provide more targeted and informative error handling.\ntry:\n    result = 10 / 0\nexcept ZeroDivisionError as e:","try:\n    result = 10 / 0\nexcept ZeroDivisionError as e:\n    print(f\"Error: {e}\")\nProvide Meaningful Error Messages\nWhen catching exceptions, take the time to provide clear and informative error messages that explain what went wrong and how the user can address the issue.\ntry:\n    file = open(\"non_existent_file.txt\", \"r\")\nexcept FileNotFoundError as e:\n    print(f\"Error: {e} - Please check the file path and try again.\")\nLog Errors for Debugging\nIn addition to providing user-friendly error messages, it's a good practice to log errors for debugging purposes. This can help you identify and fix issues more efficiently.\nimport logging","logging.basicConfig(level=logging.ERROR, filename=\"error.log\", format=\"%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s\")\n\ntry:\n    result = 10 / 0\nexcept ZeroDivisionError as e:\n    logging.error(f\"Error: {e}\")\n    print(\"An error occurred. Please check the log file for more details.\")\nHandle Exceptions at the Appropriate Level\nWhen designing your Python scripts, consider where to handle exceptions. Exceptions should be handled at the level where they can be most effectively addressed and where the appropriate context is available.\ndef divide(a, b):\n    try:\n        return a / b\n    except ZeroDivisionError as e:\n        raise ValueError(\"Cannot divide by zero\") from e","try:\n    result = divide(10, 0)\nexcept ValueError as e:\n    print(f\"Error: {e}\")\nIn this example, the divide function handles the ZeroDivisionError and raises a more meaningful ValueError exception, which is then caught and handled at the appropriate level.\nUse Context Managers for Resource Management\nUtilize context managers (the with statement) to ensure that resources, such as file handles or database connections, are properly acquired and released, even in the presence of exceptions.\nwith open(\"file.txt\", \"r\") as file:\n    content = file.read()\n    print(content)\nBy using the with statement, you can simplify your error handling and ensure that resources are cleaned up correctly.\nFollowing these best practices will help you create more robust, maintainable, and user-friendly Python scripts that can effectively handle errors and exceptions.\nSummary","Summary\nBy the end of this tutorial, you will have a comprehensive understanding of Python's error handling mechanisms, including how to use try-except blocks, handle different types of exceptions, and implement best practices for error handling in your Python scripts. This knowledge will empower you to write more resilient and maintainable Python applications that can effectively manage errors and provide a seamless user experience.","topicsLinuxDevOpsCybersecurityDatabaseDockerKubernetesGitShellNmapWiresharkHydraJavaBig DataSQLitePostgreSQLMySQLRedisMongoDBGolangC++CAnsibleData ScienceMachine LearningPandasNumPyscikit-learnMatplotlibWeb DevelopmentAlibaba CloudHTMLCSSJavaScriptReactKali LinuxshareRelated Python CoursesQuick Start with PythonLinuxPythonBeginnerThe Advanced Python MasteryLinuxPythonAdvancedPython Practice ChallengesPythonBeginnerSwitch LanguageLearn Linux, DevOps & Cybersecurity with Hands-on LabsLEARNING PATHLearn LinuxLearn DevOpsLearn CybersecurityLearn DatabaseLearn PythonLearn DockerLearn JavaLearn JenkinsLearn Machine LearningLearn Kali LinuxPROJECTS & TUTORIALSAll Interactive TutorialsLinux ProjectsPython ProjectsJava ProjectsNumpy ProjectsLinux TutorialDocker TutorialCybersecurity tutorialFree LabsLinux Commands Cheat SheetPLAYGROUNDSOnline Linux TerminalOnline Docker PlaygroundOnline Python PlaygroundOnline Golang PlaygroundOnline C++ PlaygroundOnline Java PlaygroundOnline Rust","Python PlaygroundOnline Golang PlaygroundOnline C++ PlaygroundOnline Java PlaygroundOnline Rust PlaygroundOnline MySQL PlaygroundOnline Ansible PlaygroundOnline Jenkins PlaygroundLATEST TUTORIALSPython Itertools CombinationsDocker Compose with Host NetworkSystemctl daemon-reload in LinuxMatch Patterns with Bash RegexDevOps Free LabsFind Key with Max Value in Python DictionaryLinux Free LabsBash Function Return ValuesArea and Circumference of a Circle in CCybersecurity Free LabsSUPPORT|CONTACT US|FORUM|INTERVIEW QUESTIONS|LABEX TEAMS|AFFILIATE |SITEMAP|PRIVACY POLICY|TERMS OF SERVICE ¬© 2017-2025 LabEx Technology Limited All Rights Reserved"],"metadata":[{"description":"Discover how to implement effective error handling techniques in your Python scripts.

Exception handling allows to respond to the error, instead of crashing the running program. It enables you to catch and manage errors, making your code more robust and user-friendly. Let‚Äôs look at an example:\nHandling a Simple Exception in PythonException handling helps in preventing crashes due to errors. Here‚Äôs a basic example demonstrating how to catch an exception and handle it gracefully:\n\nPython\n\n# Simple Exception Handling Example\nn = 10\ntry:\n    res = n / 0  # This will raise a ZeroDivisionError\n    \nexcept ZeroDivisionError:\n    print(\"Can't be divided by zero!\")","OutputCan't be divided by zero!\nExplanation: In this example, dividing number by 0 raises a ZeroDivisionError. The try block contains the code that might cause an exception and the except block handles the exception, printing an error message instead of stopping the program.\n\nDifference Between Exception and ErrorError: Errors are serious issues that a program should not try to handle. They are usually problems in the code‚Äôs logic or configuration and need to be fixed by the programmer. Examples include syntax errors and memory errors.Exception: Exceptions are less severe than errors and can be handled by the program. They occur due to situations like invalid input, missing files or network issues.Example:\n\nPython\n\n# Syntax Error (Error)\nprint(\"Hello world\"  # Missing closing parenthesis\n\n# ZeroDivisionError (Exception)\nn = 10\nres = n / 0","Explanation: A syntax error is a coding mistake that prevents the code from running. In contrast, an exception like ZeroDivisionError can be managed during the program‚Äôs execution using exception handling.\nSyntax and UsageException handling in Python is done using the try, except, else and finally blocks.\ntry:      # Code that might raise an exceptionexcept SomeException:      # Code to handle the exceptionelse:     # Code to run if no exception occursfinally:    # Code to run regardless of whether an exception occurs","try, except, else and finally Blockstry Block: try block lets us test a block of code for errors. Python will ‚Äútry‚Äù to execute the code in this block. If an exception occurs, execution will immediately jump to the except block.except Block: except block enables us to handle the error or exception. If the code inside the try block throws an error, Python jumps to the except block and executes it. We can handle specific exceptions or use a general except to catch all exceptions.else Block: else block is optional and if included, must follow all except blocks. The else block runs only if no exceptions are raised in the try block. This is useful for code that should execute if the try block succeeds.finally Block: finally block always runs, regardless of whether an exception occurred or not. It is typically used for cleanup operations (closing files, releasing resources).Example:","Python\n\ntry:\n    n = 0\n    res = 100 / n\n    \nexcept ZeroDivisionError:\n    print(\"You can't divide by zero!\")\n    \nexcept ValueError:\n    print(\"Enter a valid number!\")\n    \nelse:\n    print(\"Result is\", res)\n    \nfinally:\n    print(\"Execution complete.\")","OutputYou can't divide by zero!\nExecution complete.\nExplanation:\ntry block asks for user input and tries to divide 100 by the input number.except blocks handle ZeroDivisionError and ValueError.else block runs if no exception occurs, displaying the result.finally block runs regardless of the outcome, indicating the completion of execution.Common Exceptions in PythonPython has many built-in exceptions, each representing a specific error condition. Some common ones include:","Exception NameDescriptionBaseExceptionThe base class for all built-in exceptions.ExceptionThe base class for all non-exit exceptions.ArithmeticErrorBase class for all errors related to arithmetic operations.ZeroDivisionErrorRaised when a division or modulo operation is performed with zero as the divisor.OverflowErrorRaised when a numerical operation exceeds the maximum limit of a data type.FloatingPointErrorRaised when a floating-point operation fails.AssertionErrorRaised when an assert statement fails.AttributeErrorRaised when an attribute reference or assignment fails.IndexErrorRaised when a sequence subscript is out of range.KeyErrorRaised when a dictionary key is not found.MemoryErrorRaised when an operation runs out of memory.NameErrorRaised when a local or global name is not found.OSErrorRaised when a system-related operation (like file I/O) fails.TypeErrorRaised when an operation or function is applied to an object of inappropriate type.ValueErrorRaised when a function receives","or function is applied to an object of inappropriate type.ValueErrorRaised when a function receives an argument of the right type but inappropriate value.ImportErrorRaised when an import statement has issues.ModuleNotFoundErrorRaised when a module cannot be found.Python Catching ExceptionsWhen working with exceptions in Python, we can handle errors more efficiently by specifying the types of exceptions we expect. This can make code both safer and easier to debug.","Catching Specific ExceptionsCatching specific exceptions makes code to respond to different exception types differently. \nExample:","Python\n\ntry:\n    x = int(\"str\")  # This will cause ValueError\n    \n    #inverse\n    inv = 1 / x\n    \nexcept ValueError:\n    print(\"Not Valid!\")\n    \nexcept ZeroDivisionError:\n    print(\"Zero has no inverse!\")\n\nOutputNot Valid!\nExplanation:\nThe ValueError is caught because the string ‚Äústr‚Äù cannot be converted to an integer.If x were 0 and conversion successful, the ZeroDivisionError would be caught when attempting to calculate its inverse.Catching Multiple ExceptionsWe can catch multiple exceptions in a single block if we need to handle them in the same way or we can separate them if different types of exceptions require different handling.\nExample:\n\nPython\n\na = [\"10\", \"twenty\", 30]  # Mixed list of integers and strings\ntry:\n    total = int(a[0]) + int(a[1])  # 'twenty' cannot be converted to int\n    \nexcept (ValueError, TypeError) as e:\n    print(\"Error\", e)\n    \nexcept IndexError:\n    print(\"Index out of range.\")","OutputError invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'twenty'\nExplanation:\nThe ValueError is caught when trying to convert ‚Äútwenty‚Äù to an integer.TypeError might occur if the operation was incorrectly applied to non-integer types, but it‚Äôs not triggered in this specific setup.IndexError would be caught if an index outside the range of the list was accessed, but in this scenario, it‚Äôs under control.Catch-All Handlers and Their RisksHere‚Äôs a simple calculation that may fail due to various reasons.\nExample:\n\nPython\n\ntry:\n    # Simulate risky calculation: incorrect type operation\n    res = \"100\" / 20\n    \nexcept ArithmeticError:\n    print(\"Arithmetic problem.\")\n    \nexcept:\n    print(\"Something went wrong!\")","OutputSomething went wrong!\nExplanation:\nAn ArithmeticError (more specific like ZeroDivisionError) might be caught if this were a number-to-number division error. However, TypeError is actually triggered here due to attempting to divide a string by a number.catch-all except: is used to catch the TypeError, demonstrating the risk that the programmer might not realize the actual cause of the error (type mismatch) without more detailed error logging.Raise an ExceptionWe raise an exception in Python using the raise keyword followed by an instance of the exception class that we want to trigger. We can choose from built-in exceptions or define our own custom exceptions by inheriting from Python‚Äôs built-in Exception class.\nBasic Syntax:\nraise ExceptionType(‚ÄúError message‚Äù)\nExample:\n\nPython\n\ndef set(age):\n    if age < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Age cannot be negative.\")\n    print(f\"Age set to {age}\")\n\ntry:\n    set(-5)\nexcept ValueError as e:\n    print(e)","OutputAge cannot be negative.\nExplanation:","The function set checks if the age is negative. If so, it raises a ValueError with a message explaining the issue.This ensures that the age attribute cannot be set to an invalid state, thus maintaining the integrity of the data.Advantages of Exception Handling:Improved program reliability: By handling exceptions properly, you can prevent your program from crashing or producing incorrect results due to unexpected errors or input.Simplified error handling: Exception handling allows you to separate error handling code from the main program logic, making it easier to read and maintain your code.Cleaner code: With exception handling, you can avoid using complex conditional statements to check for errors, leading to cleaner and more readable code.Easier debugging: When an exception is raised, the Python interpreter prints a traceback that shows the exact location where the exception occurred, making it easier to debug your code.Disadvantages of Exception Handling:Performance overhead:","making it easier to debug your code.Disadvantages of Exception Handling:Performance overhead: Exception handling can be slower than using conditional statements to check for errors, as the interpreter has to perform additional work to catch and handle the exception.Increased code complexity: Exception handling can make your code more complex, especially if you have to handle multiple types of exceptions or implement complex error handling logic.Possible security risks: Improperly handled exceptions can potentially reveal sensitive information or create security vulnerabilities in your code, so it‚Äôs important to handle exceptions carefully and avoid exposing too much information about your program.","Comment\r\n    More info\nAdvertise with us\n\n\n\nNext Article\n\n\n\n\nUser-defined Exceptions in Python with Examples\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nN \n\n\n\nNikhil Kumar Singh\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImprove\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArticle Tags : \n\n\nPython\n\n\nSchool Programming\n \n\n\nPractice Tags : \n\npython \n\n\n\n\n\nSimilar Reads\n\n\nDecorators in Python\r\n                    \nIn Python, decorators are a powerful and flexible way to modify or extend the behavior of functions or methods, without changing their actual code.

They fetch data and manage state. Component tests allow you to verify these functional aspects of UIs.","In a nutshell, you start by supplying the appropriate props for the initial state of a component. Then simulate user behavior such as clicks and form entries. Finally, check whether the UI and component state update correctly.\nIn Storybook, this familiar workflow happens in your browser. That makes it easier to debug failures because you're running tests in the same environment as you develop components: the browser.","How does component testing in Storybook work?\nYou start by writing a story to set up the component's initial state. Then simulate user behavior using the play function. Finally, use the test-runner to confirm that the component renders correctly and that your component tests with the play function pass. The test runner can run via the command line or in CI.\n\nThe play function is a small snippet of code that runs after a story finishes rendering. You can use this to test user workflows.\nThe test is written using Storybook-instrumented versions of Vitest and Testing Library coming from the @storybook/test package.\n@storybook/addon-interactions visualizes the test in Storybook and provides a playback interface for convenient browser-based debugging.\n@storybook/test-runner is a standalone utility‚Äîpowered by Jest and Playwright‚Äîthat executes all of your interactions tests and catches broken stories.","The experimental Vitest plugin is also available, which transforms your stories into Vitest tests and runs them in a browser.\n\n\n\nSet up the interactions addon\nTo enable the full component testing experience with Storybook, you'll need to take additional steps to set it up properly. We recommend you go through the test runner documentation before proceeding with the rest of the required configuration.\nRun the following command to install the interactions addon and related dependencies.\n\n npmnpm install @storybook/test @storybook/addon-interactions --save-dev\n\nUpdate your Storybook configuration (in .storybook/main.js|ts) to include the interactions addon.","Update your Storybook configuration (in .storybook/main.js|ts) to include the interactions addon.\n\n .storybook/main.tsTypescript// Replace your-framework with the framework you are using (e.g., react-webpack5, vue3-vite)\nimport type { StorybookConfig } from '@storybook/your-framework';\n \nconst config: StorybookConfig = {\n  framework: '@storybook/your-framework',\n  stories: ['../src/**/*.mdx', '../src/**/*.stories.@(js|jsx|mjs|ts|tsx)'],\n  addons: [\n    // Other Storybook addons\n    '@storybook/addon-interactions', // üëà Register the addon\n  ],\n};\n \nexport default config;\n\nWrite a component test\nThe test itself is defined inside a play function connected to a story. Here's an example of how to set up a component test with Storybook and the play function:","LoginForm.stories.ts|tsxTypescriptimport type { Meta, StoryObj } from '@storybook/react';\n \nimport { userEvent, within, expect } from '@storybook/test';\n \nimport { LoginForm } from './LoginForm';\n \nconst meta: Meta<typeof LoginForm> = {\n  component: LoginForm,\n};\n \nexport default meta;\ntype Story = StoryObj<typeof LoginForm>;\n \nexport const EmptyForm: Story = {};\n \n/*\n * See https://storybook.js.org/docs/writing-stories/play-function#working-with-the-canvas\n * to learn more about using the canvasElement to query the DOM\n */\nexport const FilledForm: Story = {\n  play: async ({ canvasElement }) => {\n    const canvas = within(canvasElement);\n \n    // üëá Simulate interactions with the component\n    await userEvent.type(canvas.getByTestId('email'), 'email@provider.com');\n \n    await userEvent.type(canvas.getByTestId('password'), 'a-random-password');\n \n    // See https://storybook.js.org/docs/essentials/actions#automatically-matching-args to learn how to setup logging in the Actions panel","await userEvent.click(canvas.getByRole('button'));\n \n    // üëá Assert DOM structure\n    await expect(\n      canvas.getByText(\n        'Everything is perfect. Your account is ready and we should probably get you started!',\n      ),\n    ).toBeInTheDocument();\n  },\n};","Once the story loads in the UI, it simulates the user's behavior and verifies the underlying logic.","Run code before the component gets rendered\nYou can execute code before rendering by using the mount function in the play method.Here's an example of using the mockdate package to mock the Date, a useful way to make your story render in a consistent state. Page.stories.tsTypescriptimport MockDate from 'mockdate';\n \n// ...rest of story file\n \nexport const ChristmasUI: Story = {\n  async play({ mount }) {\n    MockDate.set('2024-12-25');\n    // üëá Render the component with the mocked date\n    await mount();\n    // ...rest of test\n  },\n};‚ö†Ô∏èThere are two requirements to use the mount function:\nYou must destructure the mount property from the context (the argument passed to your play function). This makes sure that Storybook does not start rendering the story before the play function begins.","Your Storybook framework or builder must be configured to transpile to ES2017 or newer. This is because destructuring statements and async/await usages are otherwise transpiled away, which prevents Storybook from recognizing your usage of mount.\nCreate mock data before renderingYou can also use mount to create mock data that you want to pass to the component. To do so, first create your data in the play function and then call the mount function with a component configured with that data. In this example, we create a mock note and pass its id to the Page component, which we call mount with. Page.stories.tsxTypescriptexport const Default: Story = {\n  play: async ({ mount, args }) => {\n    const note = await db.note.create({\n      data: { title: 'Mount inside of play' },\n    });\n \n    const canvas = await mount(\n      // üëá Pass data that is created inside of the play function to the component\n      //   For example, a just-generated UUID","//   For example, a just-generated UUID\n      <Page {...args} params={{ id: String(note.id) }} />,\n    );\n \n    await userEvent.click(await canvas.findByRole('menuitem', { name: /login to add/i }));\n  },\n  argTypes: {\n    // üëá Make the params prop un-controllable, as the value is always overriden in the play function.\n    params: { control: { disable: true } },\n  },\n};‚ÑπÔ∏èWhen you call mount() with no arguments, the component is rendered using the story‚Äôs render function, whether the implicit default or the explicit custom definition.When you mount a specific component inside the mount function like in the example above, the story‚Äôs render function will be ignored. This is why you must forward the args to the component.","Run code before each story in a file\nSometimes you might need to run the same code before each story in a file. For instance, you might need to set up the initial state of the component or modules. You can do this by adding an asynchronous beforeEach function to the component meta.\nYou can return a cleanup function from the beforeEach function, which will run after each story, when the story is remounted or navigated away from.\n‚ÑπÔ∏èGenerally, you should reset component and module state in the preview file's beforeAll or beforeEach functions, to ensure it applies to your entire project. However, if a component's needs are particularly unique, you can use the returned cleanup function in the component meta beforeEach to reset the state as needed.","Page.stories.tsTypescript// Replace your-renderer with the name of your renderer (e.g. react, vue3)\nimport type { Meta, StoryObj } from '@storybook/your-renderer';\nimport MockDate from 'mockdate';\n \n// üëá Must include the `.mock` portion of filename to have mocks typed correctly\nimport { getUserFromSession } from '#api/session.mock';\nimport { Page } from './Page';\n \nconst meta: Meta<typeof Page> = {\n  component: Page,\n  // üëá Set the value of Date for every story in the file\n  async beforeEach() {\n    MockDate.set('2024-02-14');\n \n    // üëá Reset the Date after each story\n    return () => {\n      MockDate.reset();\n    };\n  },\n};\nexport default meta;\n \ntype Story = StoryObj<typeof Page>;\n \nexport const Default: Story = {\n  async play({ canvasElement }) {\n    // ... This will run with the mocked Date\n  },\n};","Set up or reset state for all tests\nWhen you alter a component's state, it's important to reset that state before rendering another story to maintain isolation between tests.\nThere are two options for resetting state, beforeAll and beforeEach.\nbeforeAll\nThe beforeAll function in the preview file (.storybook/preview.js|ts) will run once before any stories in the project and will not re-run between stories. Beyond its initial run when kicking off a test run, it will not run again unless the preview file is updated. This is a good place to bootstrap your project or run any setup that your entire project depends on, as in the example below.\nYou can return a cleanup function from the beforeAll function, which will run before re-running the beforeAll function or during the teardown process in the test runner.",".storybook/preview.tsTypescript// Replace your-renderer with the renderer you are using (e.g., react, vue3, angular, etc.)\nimport { Preview } from '@storybook/your-renderer';\n \nimport { init } from '../project-bootstrap';\n \nconst preview: Preview = {\n  async beforeAll() {\n    await init();\n  },\n};\n \nexport default preview;\n\n\nbeforeEach\nUnlike beforeAll, which runs only once, the beforeEach function in the preview file (.storybook/preview.js|ts) will run before each story in the project. This is best used for resetting state or modules that are used by all or most of your stories.

These APIs improve your testing experience, helping you assert whether a function has been called, if an element exists in the DOM, and much more. If you are used to expect from testing packages such as Jest or Vitest, you can write component tests in much the same way.","Form.stories.ts|tsxTypescript// Replace your-framework with the name of your framework\nimport type { Meta, StoryObj } from '@storybook/your-framework';\n \nimport { userEvent, waitFor, within, expect, fn } from '@storybook/test';\n \nimport { Form } from './Form';\n \nconst meta: Meta<typeof Form> = {\n  component: Form,\n  args: {\n    // üëá Use `fn` to spy on the onSubmit arg\n    onSubmit: fn(),\n  },\n};\n \nexport default meta;\ntype Story = StoryObj<typeof Form>;\n \n/*\n * See https://storybook.js.org/docs/writing-stories/play-function#working-with-the-canvas\n * to learn more about using the canvasElement to query the DOM\n */\nexport const Submitted: Story = {\n  play: async ({ args, canvasElement, step }) => {\n    const canvas = within(canvasElement);\n \n    await step('Enter credentials', async () => {\n      await userEvent.type(canvas.getByTestId('email'), 'hi@example.com');\n      await userEvent.type(canvas.getByTestId('password'), 'supersecret');\n    });","await userEvent.type(canvas.getByTestId('password'), 'supersecret');\n    });\n \n    await step('Submit form', async () => {\n      await userEvent.click(canvas.getByRole('button'));\n    });\n \n    // üëá Now we can assert that the onSubmit arg was called\n    await waitFor(() => expect(args.onSubmit).toHaveBeenCalled());\n  },\n};","Group interactions with the step function\nFor complex flows, it can be worthwhile to group sets of related interactions together using the step function.

That gives teams a universal reference point to test and debug stories.\nExecute tests with the test-runner\nStorybook only runs the component test when you're viewing a story. Therefore, you'd have to go through each story to run all your checks. As your Storybook grows, it becomes unrealistic to review each change manually.

The biggest benefit is the ability to view the component you're testing in a real browser.

Please see below the list of ideas I tried from the community.\nI began by following this stack overflow idea. This involves selecting the Kind and Story based on the url parameter to identify the story to land on, but this did not work in our case.\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/53724555/specify-default-page-for-storybook\nThis approach also specifies using the addOnAPI from storybook addOns, to always choose the landing page to be the introduction mdx file. This did not work.\n¬†\n\nI followed the 2nd top answer suggesting to change main.js","I followed the 2nd top answer suggesting to change main.js\n\n¬†\nmodule.exports = {  stories: [    \"./Introduction.stories.mdx\",    \"../components//.stories.tsx\"  ],  addons: [    \"@storybook/addon-links\",    \"@storybook/addon-essentials\"  ]}\nThe default page issue was still not resolved. Later I noticed that this path was already configured properly as when I open storybook , the introduction page showed at top of other component stories.\n¬†\n¬†\n\nI tried following the 1st top answer with different values in¬†\n\n¬†\nstorybookAPI.selectStory('FirstKind', 'default story');\nto match the appropriate story name. It still didn't resolve the issue. So I tried selecting a different component story to check if it can set other components as default. It didn't work.\n¬†\n\nI looked for another solution:\nhttps://dev.to/committedsw/storybook-docs-first-page-1ick\n\nIt too didn't work","It too didn't work\n¬†\n\n\nI looked for storybook official docs and looked through all the related docs and found no exact clue about setting up default page loading. https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/configure/overview\n\n\nI looked into the storybook addons docs¬†https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/addons/writing-addons¬† but found no useful info.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeta\nWas this translation helpful?\nGive feedback.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n3\n You must be logged in to vote\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nAll reactions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplies: \n\n      4 comments\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n \nOldest\n\n\n\n\n \nNewest\n\n\n\n\n \nTop\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nComment options\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nQuote reply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndimitrieh\n\n\nOct 27, 2021\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n -\n           \n \n\n\n\n\n\nUnsure if this solves your usecase but you can make the first story and first page of it a documentation only page with https://storybook.js.org/addons/@storybook/addon-docs\n\n\n\n\n\nBeta\nWas this translation helpful?\nGive feedback.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n1\n You must be logged in to vote","1\n You must be logged in to vote\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nAll reactions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    0 replies\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nComment options\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nQuote reply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nshilman\n\n\nOct 28, 2021\n\n\n\n  Maintainer\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n -\n           \n \n\n\n\n\n\nStorybook shows the first story by default and the suggested approach is to make your first story a documentation page. When you navigate to the storybook, it shows this by default. One thing to note is that if you are running Storybook in dev mode (e.g. npm run storybook) and you have already been browsing a Storybook in your browser, it can reuse a tab that already has some other path selected (the last story you were browsing? i'm not sure whether this is a bug or something we have control over?). If you explicitly navigate to the path of the storybook (e.g. https://localhost:<port> where port is typically 6006 by default), it should show the first page.","Beta\nWas this translation

This approach enables developers to thoroughly test their components' functionality, responsiveness, and","approach enables developers to thoroughly test their components' functionality, responsiveness, and visual appearance across different scenarios, resulting in more robust and reliable applications.","With Cypress\nCypress is an end-to-end testing framework. It enables you to test a complete instance of your application by simulating user behavior. With Component Story Format, your stories are reusable with Cypress. Each named export (in other words, a story) is renderable within your testing setup.\nAn example of an end-to-end test with Cypress and Storybook is testing a login component for the correct inputs. For example, if you had the following story:","LoginForm.stories.ts|tsxTypescriptimport type { Meta, StoryObj } from '@storybook/react';\n \nimport { userEvent, within, expect } from '@storybook/test';\n \nimport { LoginForm } from './LoginForm';\n \nconst meta: Meta<typeof LoginForm> = {\n  component: LoginForm,\n};\n \nexport default meta;\ntype Story = StoryObj<typeof LoginForm>;\n \nexport const EmptyForm: Story = {};\n \n/*\n * See https://storybook.js.org/docs/writing-stories/play-function#working-with-the-canvas\n * to learn more about using the canvasElement to query the DOM\n */\nexport const FilledForm: Story = {\n  play: async ({ canvasElement }) => {\n    const canvas = within(canvasElement);\n \n    // üëá Simulate interactions with the component\n    await userEvent.type(canvas.getByTestId('email'), 'email@provider.com');\n \n    await userEvent.type(canvas.getByTestId('password'), 'a-random-password');\n \n    // See https://storybook.js.org/docs/essentials/actions#automatically-matching-args to learn how to setup logging in the Actions panel","await userEvent.click(canvas.getByRole('button'));\n \n    // üëá Assert DOM structure\n    await expect(\n      canvas.getByText(\n        'Everything is perfect. Your account is ready and we should probably get you started!',\n      ),\n    ).toBeInTheDocument();\n  },\n};","üí°The play function contains small snippets of code that run after the story renders. It allows you to sequence interactions in stories.\nWith Cypress, you could write the following test:\n\n /cypress/integration/Login.spec.js/// <reference types=\"cypress\" />\n \ndescribe('Login Form', () => {\n  it('Should contain valid login information', () => {\n    cy.visit('/iframe.html?id=components-login-form--example');\n    cy.get('#login-form').within(() => {\n      cy.log('**enter the email**');\n      cy.get('#email').should('have.value', 'email@provider.com');\n      cy.log('**enter password**');\n      cy.get('#password').should('have.value', 'a-random-password');\n    });\n  });\n});\n\nWhen Cypress runs your test, it loads Storybook's isolated iframe and checks if the inputs match the test values.","With Playwright\nPlaywright is a browser automation tool and end-to-end testing framework from Microsoft. It offers cross-browser automation, mobile testing with device emulation, and headless testing. With Component Story Format, your stories are reusable with Playwright. Each named export (in other words, a story) is renderable within your testing setup.\nA real-life scenario of user flow testing with Playwright would be how to test a login form for validity. For example, if you had the following story already created:","LoginForm.stories.ts|tsxTypescriptimport type { Meta, StoryObj } from '@storybook/react';\n \nimport { userEvent, within, expect } from '@storybook/test';\n \nimport { LoginForm } from './LoginForm';\n \nconst meta: Meta<typeof LoginForm> = {\n  component: LoginForm,\n};\n \nexport default meta;\ntype Story = StoryObj<typeof LoginForm>;\n \nexport const EmptyForm: Story = {};\n \n/*\n * See https://storybook.js.org/docs/writing-stories/play-function#working-with-the-canvas\n * to learn more about using the canvasElement to query the DOM\n */\nexport const FilledForm: Story = {\n  play: async ({ canvasElement }) => {\n    const canvas = within(canvasElement);\n \n    // üëá Simulate interactions with the component\n    await userEvent.type(canvas.getByTestId('email'), 'email@provider.com');\n \n    await userEvent.type(canvas.getByTestId('password'), 'a-random-password');\n \n    // See https://storybook.js.org/docs/essentials/actions#automatically-matching-args to learn how to setup logging in the Actions panel","await userEvent.click(canvas.getByRole('button'));\n \n    // üëá Assert DOM structure\n    await expect(\n      canvas.getByText(\n        'Everything is perfect.

2024--18ListenShareI‚Äôve worked on Next.js applications that scaled to over 100k monthly active users and landing pages with millions of monthly visitors. In this article, I‚Äôll share all the lessons I‚Äôve learned through countless iterations.Whether you‚Äôre part of a small team of one, two, or three developers, or you work on a massive Next.js project with multiple teams on the same codebase, it‚Äôs critical to get the foundation of your app right from the start. Even if you‚Äôre working on an existing project, you will discover some hard-earned insights that you can apply to your app today.Let me take you by the hand and show you all the steps and packages that you want to set up and explain to you why they‚Äôre useful, so your app scales smoothly.Initialize Your ProjectBegin by creating a new","you why they‚Äôre useful, so your app scales smoothly.Initialize Your ProjectBegin by creating a new Next.js project.npx create-next-app@latestIt may ask you if it can install the latest create-next-app version, just hit yes.Need to install the following packages:create-next-app@15.0.0Ok to proceed?

Discuss choices like using semicolons, quote styles, and tabs versus spaces with your team.Then use tools to enforce your style guide and format code automatically.There are two tools for that: Prettier and ESLint.PrettierPrettier is an opinionated code formatter that eliminates style","that: Prettier and ESLint.PrettierPrettier is an opinionated code formatter that eliminates style discussions during code reviews.Install Prettier together with its Tailwind plugin.npm install --save-dev prettier prettier-plugin-tailwindcssCreate aprettier.config.js file with your preferred rules.module.exports = {  arrowParens: 'avoid',  bracketSameLine: false,  bracketSpacing: true,  htmlWhitespaceSensitivity: 'css',  insertPragma: false,  jsxSingleQuote: false,  plugins: ['prettier-plugin-tailwindcss'],  printWidth: 80,  proseWrap: 'always',  quoteProps: 'as-needed',  requirePragma: false,  semi: true,  singleQuote: true,  tabWidth: 2,  trailingComma: 'all',  useTabs: false,};Add a formatting script to your package.json.\"format\": \"prettier --write .\",Run the formatter to apply your style.$ npm run format> nextjs-for-production@0.1.0 format> prettier --write .next.config.mjs 4ms (unchanged)package-lock.json 54ms (unchanged)package.json 1ms (unchanged)postcss.config.mjs 2ms","4ms (unchanged)package-lock.json 54ms (unchanged)package.json 1ms (unchanged)postcss.config.mjs 2ms (unchanged)README.md 20ms (unchanged)src/app/globals.css 17ms (unchanged)src/app/layout.tsx 30ms (unchanged)src/app/page.tsx 11ms (unchanged)tailwind.config.ts 2ms (unchanged)tsconfig.json 2ms (unchanged)Your files are now ‚Äúprettier‚Äù, but you also want to use ESLint.ESLintESLint can scan your code for both stylistic and logical issues.

For detailed descriptions, visit their respective GitHub pages.But in short, they enforce coding standards, organize imports, and ensure correct use of modern JavaScript features. Since ESLint and Prettier can conflict, this setup makes them work together smoothly. The plugins also help prevent bugs and keep styles consistent,","makes them work together smoothly. The plugins also help prevent bugs and keep styles consistent, especially with tools like Vitest and Playwright.Add a linting script to your package.json.\"lint:fix\": \"next lint --fix\",Run it to format all files according to your new rules.$ npm run lint:fix> nextjs-for-production@0.1.0 lint:fix> next lint --fix‚úî No ESLint warnings or errorsIf you get a TypeScript version warning, you can ignore that.Note: As of this article‚Äôs writing, ESLint 9 is available, but this tutorial uses ESLint 8 because many plugins do not yet support the latest version.CommitlintWhen collaborating with a large team, it‚Äôs also helpful to enforce consistent commit messages to keep the project history clear. By choosing the right standards, you can automate changelog and release generation with correct semantic versioning.Install Commitlint and its necessary configurations.

You avoid scrolling up and down in your file list to find all the files you need.Collaboration: Developers can focus on specific features without disrupting others‚Äô work.Onboarding: New developers understand the project structure faster, as all files for a feature are in one place.Refactoring: Updating a feature is streamlined since all its elements are grouped together.Modularity: Features can be reused, shared, or turned into standalone packages more easily.Micro-frontends: If your application ever grows to 30 or more engineers, it is easy to refactor to micro-frontends.Here is a more concrete example.src/‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app/‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ...‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ (group)/‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ about/‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ page.tsx‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ settings/‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ page.tsx‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ layout.tsx‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dashboard/‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ page.tsx‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ layout.tsx‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ layout.tsx‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ page.tsx‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ...‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ header/‚îÇ","‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ layout.tsx‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ layout.tsx‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ page.tsx‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ...‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ header/‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ header-component.tsx‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ header-component.test.ts‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ header.module.css‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ features/‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ...‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ todos/‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ...‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ todos-component.tsx‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ todos-component.test.ts‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ todos-container.ts‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ todos-reducer.ts‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ todos-reducer.test.ts‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ todos-styles.ts‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ user/‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ...‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ user-reducer.ts‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ user-reducer.test.ts‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hocs/‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ...‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ with-layout.tsx‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hooks/‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ redux/‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ root-reducer.ts‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ root-saga.ts‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ store.ts‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ...‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ middleware.tsThis example shows you how you can organize your src/ directory.

A facade is a design pattern where you provide a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.Create a file that contains all facades related to your user profile model features/user-profile/user-profile-model.ts.import { UserProfile } from '@prisma/client';import prisma from '@/lib/prisma';export async function retrieveUserProfileFromDatabaseByEmail(  email: UserProfile['email'],) {  return await","function retrieveUserProfileFromDatabaseByEmail(  email: UserProfile['email'],) {  return await prisma.userProfile.findUnique({ where: { email } });}There are two main reasons for using facades.Increase vendor resistance ‚Äî You can switch third-party providers easily. For example, you might switch from Firebase to Supabase or vice versa. Instead of updating your whole codebase to reflect the change, you only update the facade.Simplify your code ‚Äî A facade can reduce the code you need to write in your application because it reduces the API to your specific application needs. Simultaneously, it makes your code easier to understand because you can give the facade descriptive names.Then use your facade in your server component.import { retrieveUserProfileFromDatabaseByEmail } from '@/features/user-profiles/user-profiles-model';import {  Card,  CardContent,  CardHeader,  CardTitle,} from '@/components/ui/card';export default async function Dashboard() {  const user =    await","from '@/components/ui/card';export default async function Dashboard() {  const user =    await retrieveUserProfileFromDatabaseByEmail('jan@reactsquad.io');  return (    <Card className=\"max-w-md mx-auto\">      <CardHeader>        <CardTitle>User Profile</Card.Title>      </CardHeader>      <CardContent>        {user ? (          <ul>            <li>Name: {user.name}</li>            <li>Email: {user.email}</li>          </ul>        ) : (          <p>User not found.</p>        )}      </CardContent>    </Card>  );}Vercel PostgresYou can use Vercel Postgres for your production deployment. They have an easy to follow guide, which you can check out in the Vercel documentation. But here are the steps real quick for your convenience.To set up a database in your Vercel project, follow these steps:Go to the Storage tab and click the Create Database button.When the Browse Storage modal opens, choose Postgres and click Continue.For creating a new database:In the dialog box, type","modal opens, choose Postgres and click Continue.For creating a new database:In the dialog box, type sample_postgres_db (or a name you prefer) in the Store Name field. Ensure the name has only alphanumeric characters, \"_\" or \"-\", and does not exceed 32 characters.Choose a region. For lower latency, select a region close to your function region, which is US East by default.Click Create.Then you‚Äôll need to add POSTGRES_URL_NON_POOLING to the datasource in your Prisma schema.datasource db {  provider  = \"postgresql\"  // Uses connection pooling  url       = env(\"DATABASE_URL\")  // Uses direct connection, ‚ö†Ô∏è make sure to keep this to `POSTGRES_URL_NON_POOLING`  // or you'll have dangling databases from migrations  directUrl = env(\"POSTGRES_URL_NON_POOLING\")}Vercel uses connection poolers, which manage a pool of database connections that can be reused by different parts of an application, rather than establishing a new connection for each database request. The directUrl property is used to","than establishing a new connection for each database request. The directUrl property is used to ensure operations requiring direct database access, such as migrations, can bypass the connection pooler for reliable execution.You can get the environment variables for your Vercel database by pulling them from Vercel.vercel env pull .envPlaywrightYou also want to use E2E tests because E2E tests give you the most confidence that your app works as intended. E2E tests are skipped far too often, but you really should make it a habit to write them. The benefits are compounding.Initialize Playwright.$ npm init playwright@latestGetting started with writing end-to-end tests with Playwright:Initializing project in '.'‚úî Where to put your end-to-end tests? ¬∑ playwright‚úî Add a GitHub Actions workflow?

(Y/n) ¬∑ trueIf this is your first time using Playwright, you can have a look through the test-examples/","¬∑ trueIf this is your first time using Playwright, you can have a look through the test-examples/ folder that the initialization script creates, and then deleted it because you won't need it.Modify the webServer key in your playwright.config.ts file.webServer: {  command: process.env.CI ? 'npm run build && npm run start' : 'npm run dev',  port: 3000,},Add two scripts for your E2E tests to your package.json.\"test:e2e\": \"npx playwright test\",\"test:e2e:ui\": \"npx playwright test --ui\",The first one runs your Playwright test in headless mode, while the second one runs your test in UI mode, which gives you time travel debugging, watch mode and more.import { expect, test } from '@playwright/test';test.describe('landing page', () => {  test('given any user: shows the test user', async ({ page }) => {    await page.goto('/');    await expect(page.getByText('Jan Hesters')).toBeVisible();    await expect(page.getByText('jan@reactsquad.io')).toBeVisible();  });});Run your tests to check that your","expect(page.getByText('jan@reactsquad.io')).toBeVisible();  });});Run your tests to check that your Playwright setup worked.$ npm run test:e2e> reactsquad-production@0.1.0 test:e2e> npx playwright testRunning 3 tests using 3 workers  3 passed (3.9s)It ran three tests because by default Playwright is configured to run in Chrome, Safari, and Firefox.GitHub ActionsIt‚Äôs good practice to run your app with CI/CD. CI/CD stands for continuous delivery and continuous deployment.Add a secret for your database URL to your repository‚Äôs settings in GitHub.DATABASE_URL=\"postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/testdb\"Then create your GitHub Actions YAML configuration in a .github/workflows/pull-request.yml file for a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline including linting, type checking, testing, and more.name: Pull Requeston: [pull_request]jobs:  lint:    name: ‚¨£ ESLint    runs-on: ubuntu-latest    steps:      - name: ‚¨áÔ∏è Checkout repo        uses: actions/checkout@v3      - name: ‚éî Setup node","- name: ‚¨áÔ∏è Checkout repo        uses: actions/checkout@v3      - name: ‚éî Setup node        uses: actions/setup-node@v3        with:          node-version: 20      - name: üì• Download deps        uses: bahmutov/npm-install@v1      - name: üî¨ Lint        run: npm run lint  type-check:    name:  ¶ TypeScript    runs-on: ubuntu-latest    steps:      - name: ‚¨áÔ∏è Checkout repo        uses: actions/checkout@v3      - name: ‚éî Setup node        uses: actions/setup-node@v3        with:          node-version: 20      - name: üì• Download deps        uses: bahmutov/npm-install@v1      - name: üîé Type check        run: npm run type-check --if-present  commitlint:    name: ‚öôÔ∏è commitlint    runs-on: ubuntu-latest    if: github.actor != 'dependabot[bot]'    env:      GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}    steps:      - name: ‚¨áÔ∏è Checkout repo        uses: actions/checkout@v3        with:          fetch-depth: 0      - name: ‚öôÔ∏è commitlint        uses: wagoid/commitlint-github-action@v4  vitest:","0      - name: ‚öôÔ∏è commitlint        uses: wagoid/commitlint-github-action@v4  vitest:    name: ‚ö° Vitest    runs-on: ubuntu-latest    services:      postgres:        image: postgres:12        env:          POSTGRES_USER: postgres          POSTGRES_PASSWORD: postgres          POSTGRES_DB: testdb        ports:          - 5432:5432    steps:      - name: ‚¨áÔ∏è Checkout repo        uses: actions/checkout@v3      - name: ‚éî Setup node        uses: actions/setup-node@v3        with:          node-version: 20      - name: üì• Download deps        uses: bahmutov/npm-install@v1      - name: üõ† Setup Database        run: npm run prisma:wipe        env:          DATABASE_URL: postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/testdb      - name: ‚ö° Run vitest        run: npm run test -- --coverage        env:          DATABASE_URL: postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/testdb  playwright:    name: üé≠ Playwright    runs-on: ubuntu-latest    services:      postgres:        image: postgres:12        env:","runs-on: ubuntu-latest    services:      postgres:        image: postgres:12        env:          POSTGRES_USER: postgres          POSTGRES_PASSWORD: postgres          POSTGRES_DB: testdb        ports:          - 5432:5432    steps:      - name: ‚¨áÔ∏è Checkout repo        uses: actions/checkout@v3      - name: ‚éî Setup node        uses: actions/setup-node@v3        with:          node-version: 20      - name: üì• Download deps        uses: bahmutov/npm-install@v1      - name: üåê Install Playwright Browsers        run: npx playwright install --with-deps      - name: üõ† Setup Database        run: npm run prisma:wipe        env:          DATABASE_URL: postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/testdb      - name: üé≠ Playwright Run        run: npx playwright test        env:          DATABASE_URL: postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/testdb      - name: üì∏ Playwright Screenshots        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4        if: failure()        with:          name: playwright-report","uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4        if: failure()        with:          name: playwright-report          path: playwright-report/          retention-days: 30Now every time you make a pull request to your app, it automatically runs your tests to ensure it works, runs TypeScript type checks and lints it, so that everyone contributes code with the same formatting.NextjsJavaScriptNextjs 15Tutorial----18FollowWritten by Jan Hesters1K Followers¬∑10 FollowingSubscribe on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/@JanHesters Follow on X: https://x.com/janhesters Ask better questions.FollowResponses (18)See all responsesHelpStatusAboutCareersPressBlogPrivacyRulesTermsText to speech"],"metadata":[{"description":"I‚Äôve worked on Next.js applications that scaled to over 100k monthly active users and landing pages with millions of monthly visitors.

In this article, I'll share all the lessons I've learned through countless iterations.Whether you're part of a small team of one, two, or three developers, or you work on a massive Next.js project with multiple teams on the same codebase, it's critical to get the foundation of your app right from the start. Even if you're working on an existing project, you will discover some hard-earned insights that you can apply to your app today.Let me take you by the hand and show you all the steps and packages that you want to set up and explain to you why they're useful, so your app scales","and packages that you want to set up and explain to you why they're useful, so your app scales smoothly.Initialize Your ProjectBegin by creating a new Next.js project.npx create-next-app@latest","It may ask you if it can install the latest create-next-app version, just hit yes.Need to install the following packages:\ncreate-next-app@15.0.0\nOk to proceed? (y)\nAnd then configure your project by hitting yes on everything (TypeScript, Tailwind, app router).‚úî **What is your project named?** ‚Ä¶ reactsquad-production\n‚úî **Would you like to use** **TypeScript****?** ‚Ä¶ No / Yes\nYes\n‚úî **Would you like to use** **ESLint****?** ‚Ä¶ No / Yes\nYes\n‚úî **Would you like to use** **Tailwind CSS****?** ‚Ä¶ No / Yes\nYes\n‚úî **Would you like to use** **`src/` directory****?** ‚Ä¶ No / Yes\nYes\n‚úî **Would you like to use** **App Router****? (recommended)** ‚Ä¶ No / Yes\nYes\n‚úî **Would you like to customize the default** **import alias** **(@/*)?** ‚Ä¶ No / No\nThen change into the directory of your project and open it in your favorite editor.$ cd nextjs-for-production\n~/dev/nextjs-for-production (main) ü§Ø\n$ cursor .","~/dev/nextjs-for-production (main) ü§Ø\n$ cursor .\nRun The Development ServerYou want to verify that your setup worked.Run npm run dev to start the development server.Visit http://localhost:3000 to view your application.Type Checks With TypeScriptYour project has TypeScript already configured, but you also want to add an explicit command to your package.json that checks all your files for type errors.\"type-check\": \"tsc -b\"","You're going to use this command later together with other automated static analysis checks.Code FormattingWhen you collaborate with a large team on a project, it's important to unify the way that everyone writes code. Discuss choices like using semicolons, quote styles, and tabs versus spaces with your team.Then use tools to enforce your style guide and format code automatically.There are two tools for that: Prettier and ESLint.PrettierPrettier is an opinionated code formatter that eliminates style discussions during code reviews.Install Prettier together with its Tailwind plugin.npm install --save-dev prettier prettier-plugin-tailwindcss\nCreate a prettier.config.js file with your preferred rules.module.exports = {\n  arrowParens: 'avoid',\n  bracketSameLine: false,\n  bracketSpacing: true,\n  htmlWhitespaceSensitivity: 'css',\n  insertPragma: false,\n  jsxSingleQuote: false,\n  plugins: ['prettier-plugin-tailwindcss'],\n  printWidth: 80,\n  proseWrap: 'always',\n  quoteProps: 'as-needed',","printWidth: 80,\n  proseWrap: 'always',\n  quoteProps: 'as-needed',\n  requirePragma: false,\n  semi: true,\n  singleQuote: true,\n  tabWidth: 2,\n  trailingComma: 'all',\n  useTabs: false,\n};\nAdd a formatting script to your package.json.\"format\": \"prettier --write .\",\nRun the formatter to apply your style.$ npm run format","> nextjs-for-production@0.1.0 format\n> prettier --write .","next.config.mjs 4ms (unchanged)\npackage-lock.json 54ms (unchanged)\npackage.json 1ms (unchanged)\npostcss.config.mjs 2ms (unchanged)\nREADME.md 20ms (unchanged)\nsrc/app/globals.css 17ms (unchanged)\nsrc/app/layout.tsx 30ms (unchanged)\nsrc/app/page.tsx 11ms (unchanged)\ntailwind.config.ts 2ms (unchanged)\ntsconfig.json 2ms (unchanged)\nYour files are now \"prettier\", but you also want to use ESLint.ESLintESLint can scan your code for both stylistic and logical issues. Install ESLint and its plugins, like unicorn, playwright and import sort.npm install --save-dev @typescript-eslint/parser eslint-plugin-unicorn eslint-plugin-import eslint-plugin-playwright eslint-config-prettier eslint-plugin-prettier eslint-plugin-simple-import-sort\nUpdate your .eslintrc.json.{\n  \"extends\": [\n    \"next/core-web-vitals\",\n    \"plugin:unicorn/recommended\",\n    \"plugin:import/recommended\",\n    \"plugin:playwright/recommended\",\n    \"plugin:prettier/recommended\"\n  ],\n  \"plugins\": [\"simple-import-sort\"],\n  \"rules\": {","\"plugin:prettier/recommended\"\n  ],\n  \"plugins\": [\"simple-import-sort\"],\n  \"rules\": {\n    \"simple-import-sort/exports\": \"error\",\n    \"simple-import-sort/imports\": \"error\",\n    \"unicorn/no-array-callback-reference\": \"off\",\n    \"unicorn/no-array-for-each\": \"off\",\n    \"unicorn/no-array-reduce\": \"off\",\n    \"unicorn/prevent-abbreviations\": [\n      \"error\",\n      {\n        \"allowList\": {\n          \"e2e\": true\n        },\n        \"replacements\": {\n          \"props\": false,\n          \"ref\": false,\n          \"params\": false\n        }\n      }\n    ]\n  },\n  \"overrides\": [\n    {\n      \"files\": [\"*.js\"],\n      \"rules\": {\n        \"unicorn/prefer-module\": \"off\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}","\"rules\": {\n        \"unicorn/prefer-module\": \"off\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\nThis tutorial's plugins offer different functions. For detailed descriptions, visit their respective GitHub pages.But in short, they enforce coding standards, organize imports, and ensure correct use of modern JavaScript features. Since ESLint and Prettier can conflict, this setup makes them work together smoothly. The plugins also help prevent bugs and keep styles consistent, especially with tools like Vitest and Playwright.Add a linting script to your package.json.\"lint:fix\": \"next lint --fix\",\nRun it to format all files according to your new rules.$ npm run lint:fix","> nextjs-for-production@0.1.0 lint:fix\n> next lint --fix","‚úî No ESLint warnings or errors\nIf you get a TypeScript version warning, you can ignore that.Note: As of this article's writing, ESLint 9 is available, but this tutorial uses ESLint 8 because many plugins do not yet support the latest version.CommitlintWhen collaborating with a large team, it's also helpful to enforce consistent commit messages to keep the project history clear. By choosing the right standards, you can automate changelog and release generation with correct semantic versioning.Install Commitlint and its necessary configurations. This includes Husky, which helps manage Git hooks.npm install --save-dev @commitlint/cli@latest @commitlint/config-conventional@latest husky@latest\nInitialize Husky in your project to set up the basic configuration.npx husky-init && npm install\nAdd hooks to automate linting and type checking before each commit, and customize your commit message workflow.npx husky add .husky/pre-commit 'npm run lint && npm run type-check'","npx husky add .husky/prepare-commit-msg 'exec < /dev/tty && npx cz --hook || true'\nThe pre-commit hook runs after git commit, but before the commit message is finalized and runs linting and type-checking on your code.The prepare-commit-msg hook runs after git commit is initiated but before the commit message editor opens. It runs commitizen CLI to let you craft conventional commit messages. You'll learn how to use this hook in a bit.Remove the line that says npm test from .husky/_/pre-commit.Make sure these scripts are executable.chmod a+x .husky/pre-commit\nchmod a+x .husky/prepare-commit-msg\nHere, chmod stands for \"change mode.\" This command allows you to change the access permissions or modes of a file or directory in Unix and Unix-like operating systems. The argument a+x adds execute permissions for all users.Install Commitizen, which provides a CLI for crafting conventional commit messages.npm install --save-dev commitizen cz-conventional-changelog","Configure Commitizen in your package.json to use the conventional changelog standard.\"config\": {\n  \"commitizen\": {\n    \"path\": \"cz-conventional-changelog\"\n  }\n},\nThe conventional changeloge standard is a specification for adding human and machine-readable meaning to commit messages. It is designed to automate the producing of changelogs and releases based on the Git history of your project.A future article will explain this standard in detail. It's included in this tutorial because getting it right from the start is important. You can use it and benefit from it without needing an in-depth understanding.Create your commitlint.config.cjs file with rules that suit your team's needs.

It has the following benefits:Scalability: Large applications are easier to scale and maintain because each feature acts like a mini-application. You avoid scrolling up and down in your file list to find all the files you need.Collaboration: Developers can focus on specific features without disrupting others‚Äô work.Onboarding: New developers understand the project structure faster, as all files for a feature are in one place.Refactoring: Updating a feature is streamlined since all its elements are grouped together.Modularity: Features can be reused, shared, or turned into standalone packages more easily.Micro-frontends: If your application ever grows to 30 or more engineers, it is easy to refactor to micro-frontends.Here is a more concrete example.src/","‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app/\n‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ...\n‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ (group)/\n‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ about/\n‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ page.tsx\n‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ settings/\n‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ page.tsx\n‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ layout.tsx\n‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dashboard/\n‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ page.tsx\n‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ layout.tsx\n‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ layout.tsx\n‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ page.tsx\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/\n‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ...\n‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ header/\n‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ header-component.tsx\n‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ header-component.test.ts\n‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ header.module.css\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ features/\n‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ...\n‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ todos/\n‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ...\n‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ todos-component.tsx\n‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ todos-component.test.ts\n‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ todos-container.ts\n‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ todos-reducer.ts\n‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ todos-reducer.test.ts\n‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ todos-styles.ts\n‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ user/\n‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ...\n‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ user-reducer.ts\n‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ user-reducer.test.ts\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hocs/\n‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ...\n‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ with-layout.tsx\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hooks/\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ redux/\n‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ root-reducer.ts\n‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ root-saga.ts\n‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ store.ts\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ...\n‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ middleware.ts","‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ redux/\n‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ root-reducer.ts\n‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ root-saga.ts\n‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ store.ts\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ...\n‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ middleware.ts\nThis example shows you how you can organize your src/ directory. Generally, everything is grouped by feature. Tests files live next to their respective implementation files. But anything that is shared by multiple features is then grouped in general folders, such as components/ or HOCs/ or hooks/. Shared setup for state management - in this example for Redux - lives in a redux/ folder.Some people also like to group by feature within the app/ folder. Here is how that would look like.src/\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app/\n‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ...\n‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ (group)/\n‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dashboard/\n‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/\n‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dashboard-header.tsx\n‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dashboard-header.test.ts\n‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dashboard-widgets.tsx\n‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ dashboard-widgets.test.ts\n‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ services/\n‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ fetch-data.ts\n‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ fetch-data.test.ts\n‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ auth-service.ts\n‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ auth-service.test.ts","‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ auth-service.ts\n‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ auth-service.test.ts\n‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ page.tsx\n‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ layout.ts\n‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ layout.tsx\n‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ page.tsx\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ...\n‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ middleware.ts\nIn this tutorial, you're going to group files by feature in the first way.VitestIf you want to avoid bugs and prevent regressions, you need to write tests. Vitest is a great choice because it has the same API as the most popular framework, which is Jest, but it runs faster.Install Vitest.npm install -D vitest\nAnd configure a testing command in your package.json.\"test\": \"vitest --reporter=verbose\",\nThen create an example.test.ts file and write a short test to check to check Vitest works.import { describe, expect, test } from 'vitest';","describe('example', () => {\n  test('given a passing test: passes', () => {\n    expect(1).toStrictEqual(1);\n  });\n});\nIt should pass.$ npm test\n\n> nextjs-for-production@0.1.0 test\n> vitest --reporter=verbose\n\n\n DEV  v2.0.5 /Users/jan/dev/nextjs-for-production\n\n ‚úì src/example.test.ts (1)\n   ‚úì example (1)\n     ‚úì given a passing test: passes\n\n Test Files  1 passed (1)\n      Tests  1 passed (1)\n   Start at  14:06:24\n   Duration  203ms (transform 20ms, setup 0ms, collect 17ms, tests 1ms, environment 0ms, prepare 56ms)","PASS  Waiting for file changes...\n       press h to show help, press q to quit\nIf you want to learn how you can write better tests, check out this article that teaches you 12 evergreen testing principles that every senior developer should know.React Testing LibraryYou also want to write tests for your React components. For that, you can use the React Testing Library, often abbreviated as RTL.npm install --save-dev @testing-library/react @testing-library/dom @testing-library/jest-dom @testing-library/user-event @types/react @types/react-dom happy-dom @vitejs/plugin-react vite-tsconfig-paths\nThen, create a vitest.config.ts file.import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react';\nimport tsconfigPaths from 'vite-tsconfig-paths';\nimport { defineConfig } from 'vitest/config';","export default defineConfig({\n  plugins: [react(), tsconfigPaths()],\n  server: {\n    port: 3000,\n  },\n  test: {\n    environment: 'happy-dom',\n    globals: true,\n    setupFiles: ['./src/tests/setup-test-environment.ts'],\n    include: ['./src/**/*.{spec,test}.{js,mjs,cjs,ts,mts,cts,jsx,tsx}'],\n    watch: {\n      ignored: [\n        String.raw`.*\\\\/node_modules\\\\/.*`,\n        String.raw`.*\\\\/build\\\\/.*`,\n        String.raw`.*\\\\/postgres-data\\\\/.*`,\n      ],\n    },\n    coverage: {\n      reporter: ['text', 'json', 'html'],\n    },\n  },\n});\nIt sets up the development server, specifies testing parameters like that the ¬†environment is happy-dom and file paths, and defines coverage report formats.And create a file called src/tests/setup-test-environment.ts to set up your test environment.import '@testing-library/jest-dom/vitest';\n\n// See <https://reactjs.org/blog/2022/03/08/react-18-upgrade-guide.html#configuring-your-testing-environment>.","// @ts-ignore\nglobalThis.IS_REACT_ACT_ENVIRONMENT = true;\nThe first line imports additional assertions, which extend Vitest's built-in assertions, allowing you to more easily test DOM nodes. For example, you can check if an element is visible, has a certain text content, or includes specific attributes.The global environment flag ensures that tests involving state updates work as expected without timing issues.Next, you want to set up a custom render method src/tests/react-test-utils.tsx./* eslint-disable import/export */\nimport type { RenderOptions } from '@testing-library/react';\nimport { render } from '@testing-library/react';\nimport type { ReactElement } from 'react';\n\nconst customRender = (\n  ui: ReactElement,\n  options?: Omit<RenderOptions, 'queries'>,\n) =>\n  render(ui, {\n    wrapper: ({ children }) => <>{children}</>,\n    ...options,\n  });\n\n// re-export everything\nexport * from '@testing-library/react';","// re-export everything\nexport * from '@testing-library/react';\n\n// override render method\nexport { customRender as render };\nexport { default as userEvent } from '@testing-library/user-event';\nYou can use this to wrap your code in providers, for example, when using Redux, or adding layouts and styling.Make sure your configuration worked by writing a test for a React component.import { describe, expect, test } from 'vitest';\n\nimport { render, screen } from '@/tests/react-test-utils';\n\nfunction MyReactComponent() {\n  return <div>My React Component</div>;\n}\n\ndescribe('MyReactComponent', () => {\n  test('given no props: renders a text', () => {\n    render(<MyReactComponent />);","expect(screen.getByText('My React Component')).toBeInTheDocument();\n  });\n});\nYou import render and screen from your test utils file instead of from RTL directly.toBeInTheDocument() is one of those special assertions that you configured earlier in your test environment setup file.It should pass, too. ‚úì src/features/example.test.tsx (1)\n   ‚úì MyReactComponent (1)\n     ‚úì given no props: renders a text\n\n Test Files  1 passed (1)\n      Tests  1 passed (1)\n   Start at  09:33:32\n   Duration  402ms (transform 24ms, setup 55ms, collect 87ms, tests 9ms, environment 80ms, prepare 45ms)","PASS  Waiting for file changes...\n       press h to show help, press q to quit\nStylingNow let's talk about styling.

The negotiator package helps your app to figure out what type of content (like language or format) your user's browser can handle best, based on the information the browser sends.You'll also need to install the TypeScript types for the negotiator package.npm install --save-dev @types/negotiator\nThen, create your i18n config in a new file at src/features/internationalization/i18n-config.ts.export const i18n = {\n  defaultLocale: 'en-US',\n  locales: ['en-US'],\n} as const;","export type Locale = (typeof i18n)['locales'][number];\nUse that i18n config, in your localization-middleware at src/features/internationalization/localization-middleware.ts.import { match } from '@formatjs/intl-localematcher';\nimport Negotiator from 'negotiator';\nimport { type NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server';\n\nimport { i18n } from './i18n-config';\n\nfunction getLocale(request: NextRequest) {\n  const headers = {\n    'accept-language': request.headers.get('accept-language') ??

You can use it to seed your database with data for development.import { exit } from 'node:process';","import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client';\nimport dotenv from 'dotenv';\n\ndotenv.config({ path: '.env.local' });\n\nconst prisma = new PrismaClient();\n\nconst prettyPrint = (object: any) =>\n  console.log(JSON.stringify(object, undefined, 2));\n\nasync function seed() {\n  const user = await prisma.userProfile.create({\n    data: {\n      email: 'jan@reactsquad.io',\n      name: 'Jan Hesters',\n      acceptedTermsAndConditions: true,\n    },\n  });\n\n  console.log('========= üå± result of seed: =========');\n  prettyPrint({ user });\n}\n\nseed()\n  .then(async () => {\n    await prisma.$disconnect();\n  })\n  // eslint-disable-next-line unicorn/prefer-top-level-await\n  .catch(async error => {\n    console.error(error);\n    await prisma.$disconnect();\n    exit(1);\n  });\nIf you run it, it'll create your user.$ npm run prisma:seed\n\n> reactsquad-production@0.1.0 prisma:seed\n> tsx ./prisma/seed.ts","> reactsquad-production@0.1.0 prisma:seed\n> tsx ./prisma/seed.ts\n\n========= üå± result of seed: =========\n{\n  \"user\": {\n    \"id\": \"clzekb5sp0000ock9gsp72p33\",\n    \"createdAt\": \"2024-08-03T20:04:27.289Z\",\n    \"updatedAt\": \"2024-08-03T20:04:27.289Z\",\n    \"email\": \"jan@reactsquad.io\",\n    \"name\": \"Jan Hesters\",\n    \"acceptedTermsAndConditions\": true\n  }\n}\nIn your server components, you can use prisma to fetch any data.import prisma from '@/lib/prisma';\nimport {\n  Card,\n  CardContent,\n  CardHeader,\n  CardTitle,\n} from '@/components/ui/card';\n\nexport default async function Dashboard() {\n  const user = await prisma.userProfile.findUnique({\n    where: { email: 'jan@reactsquad.io' },\n  });","return (\n    <Card className=\"max-w-md mx-auto\">\n      <CardHeader>\n        <CardTitle>User Profile</Card.Title>\n      </CardHeader>\n      <CardContent>\n        {user ? (\n          <ul>\n            <li>Name: {user.name}</li>\n            <li>Email: {user.email}</li>\n          </ul>\n        ) : (\n          <p>User not found.</p>\n        )}\n      </CardContent>\n    </Card>\n  );\n}\nUse FacadesIt's a good idea to abstract away your database calls using facades. A facade is a design pattern where you provide a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.Create a file that contains all facades related to your user profile model features/user-profile/user-profile-model.ts.import { UserProfile } from '@prisma/client';\n\nimport prisma from '@/lib/prisma';","import prisma from '@/lib/prisma';\n\nexport async function retrieveUserProfileFromDatabaseByEmail(\n  email: UserProfile['email'],\n) {\n  return await prisma.userProfile.findUnique({ where: { email } });\n}\nThere are two main reasons for using facades.Increase vendor resistance - You can switch third-party providers easily. For example, you might switch from Firebase to Supabase or vice versa. Instead of updating your whole codebase to reflect the change, you only update the facade.Simplify your code - A facade can reduce the code you need to write in your application because it reduces the API to your specific application needs. Simultaneously, it makes your code easier to understand because you can give the facade descriptive names.Then use your facade in your server component.import { retrieveUserProfileFromDatabaseByEmail } from '@/features/user-profiles/user-profiles-model';\nimport {\n  Card,\n  CardContent,\n  CardHeader,\n  CardTitle,\n} from '@/components/ui/card';","export default async function Dashboard() {\n  const user =\n    await retrieveUserProfileFromDatabaseByEmail('jan@reactsquad.io');\n\n  return (\n    <Card className=\"max-w-md mx-auto\">\n      <CardHeader>\n        <CardTitle>User Profile</Card.Title>\n      </CardHeader>","<CardContent>\n        {user ? (\n          <ul>\n            <li>Name: {user.name}</li>\n            <li>Email: {user.email}</li>\n          </ul>\n        ) : (\n          <p>User not found.</p>\n        )}\n      </CardContent>\n    </Card>\n  );\n}",") : (\n          <p>User not found.</p>\n        )}\n      </CardContent>\n    </Card>\n  );\n}\nVercel PostgresYou can use Vercel Postgres for your production deployment. They have an easy to follow guide, which you can check out in the Vercel documentation. But here are the steps real quick for your convenience.To set up a database in your Vercel project, follow these steps:Go to the Storage tab and click the Create Database button.When the Browse Storage modal opens, choose Postgres and click Continue.For creating a new database:In the dialog box, type sample_postgres_db (or a name you prefer) in the Store Name field. Ensure the name has only alphanumeric characters, \"_\" or \"-\", and does not exceed 32 characters.Choose a region. For lower latency, select a region close to your function region, which is US East by default.Click Create.Then you'll need to add POSTGRES_URL_NON_POOLING to the datasource in your Prisma schema.datasource db {\n  provider  = \"postgresql\"","provider  = \"postgresql\"\n  // Uses connection pooling\n  url       = env(\"DATABASE_URL\")\n  // Uses direct connection, ‚ö†Ô∏è make sure to keep this to `POSTGRES_URL_NON_POOLING`\n  // or you'll have dangling databases from migrations\n  directUrl = env(\"POSTGRES_URL_NON_POOLING\")\n}\nVercel uses connection poolers, which manage a pool of database connections that can be reused by different parts of an application, rather than establishing a new connection for each database request. The directUrl property is used to ensure operations requiring direct database access, such as migrations, can bypass the connection pooler for reliable execution.You can get the environment variables for your Vercel database by pulling them from Vercel.vercel env pull .env","PlaywrightYou also want to use E2E tests because E2E tests give you the most confidence that your app works as intended. E2E tests are skipped far too often, but you really should make it a habit to write them. The benefits are compounding.Initialize Playwright.$ npm init playwright@latest\nGetting started with writing end-to-end tests with Playwright:\nInitializing project in '.'\n‚úî Where to put your end-to-end tests? ¬∑ playwright\n‚úî Add a GitHub Actions workflow? (y/N) ¬∑ false\n‚úî Install Playwright browsers (can be done manually via 'npx playwright install')? (Y/n) ¬∑ true\nIf this is your first time using Playwright, you can have a look through the test-examples/ folder that the initialization script creates, and then deleted it because you won't need it.Modify the webServer key in your playwright.config.ts file.webServer: {\n  command: process.env.CI ? 'npm run build && npm run start' : 'npm run dev',\n  port: 3000,\n},","command: process.env.CI ? 'npm run build && npm run start' : 'npm run dev',\n  port: 3000,\n},\nAdd two scripts for your E2E tests to your package.json.\"test:e2e\": \"npx playwright test\",\n\"test:e2e:ui\": \"npx playwright test --ui\",\nThe first one runs your Playwright test in headless mode, while the second one runs your test in UI mode, which gives you time travel debugging, watch mode and more.import { expect, test } from '@playwright/test';","test.describe('landing page', () => {\n  test('given any user: shows the test user', async ({ page }) => {\n    await page.goto('/');\n\n    await expect(page.getByText('Jan Hesters')).toBeVisible();\n    await expect(page.getByText('jan@reactsquad.io')).toBeVisible();\n  });\n});\nRun your tests to check that your Playwright setup worked.$ npm run test:e2e\n\n> reactsquad-production@0.1.0 test:e2e\n> npx playwright test","> reactsquad-production@0.1.0 test:e2e\n> npx playwright test\n\n\nRunning 3 tests using 3 workers\n  3 passed (3.9s)\nt ran three tests because by default Playwright is configured to run in Chrome, Safari, and Firefox.GitHub ActionsIt's good practice to run your app with CI/CD. CI/CD stands for continuous delivery and continuous deployment.Add a secret for your database URL to your repository's settings in GitHub.DATABASE_URL=\"postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/testdb\"\nThen create your GitHub Actions YAML configuration in a .github/workflows/pull-request.yml file for a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline including linting, type checking, testing, and more.name: Pull Request\n\non: [pull_request]\n\njobs:\n  lint:\n    name: ‚¨£ ESLint\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - name: ‚¨áÔ∏è Checkout repo\n        uses: actions/checkout@v3\n\n      - name: ‚éî Setup node\n        uses: actions/setup-node@v3\n        with:\n          node-version: 20","- name: üì• Download deps\n        uses: bahmutov/npm-install@v1\n\n      - name: üî¨ Lint\n        run: npm run lint\n\n  type-check:\n    name:  ¶ TypeScript\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - name: ‚¨áÔ∏è Checkout repo\n        uses: actions/checkout@v3\n\n      - name: ‚éî Setup node\n        uses: actions/setup-node@v3\n        with:\n          node-version: 20\n\n      - name: üì• Download deps\n        uses: bahmutov/npm-install@v1\n\n      - name: üîé Type check\n        run: npm run type-check --if-present\n\n  commitlint:\n    name: ‚öôÔ∏è commitlint\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    if: github.actor != 'dependabot[bot]'\n    env:\n      GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n    steps:\n      - name: ‚¨áÔ∏è Checkout repo\n        uses: actions/checkout@v3\n        with:\n          fetch-depth: 0\n      - name: ‚öôÔ∏è commitlint\n        uses: wagoid/commitlint-github-action@v4","vitest:\n    name: ‚ö° Vitest\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    services:\n      postgres:\n        image: postgres:12\n        env:\n          POSTGRES_USER: postgres\n          POSTGRES_PASSWORD: postgres\n          POSTGRES_DB: testdb\n        ports:\n          - 5432:5432\n    steps:\n      - name: ‚¨áÔ∏è Checkout repo\n        uses: actions/checkout@v3\n\n      - name: ‚éî Setup node\n        uses: actions/setup-node@v3\n        with:\n          node-version: 20\n\n      - name: üì• Download deps\n        uses: bahmutov/npm-install@v1\n\n      - name: üõ† Setup Database\n        run: npm run prisma:wipe\n        env:\n          DATABASE_URL: postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/testdb\n\n      - name: ‚ö° Run vitest\n        run: npm run test -- --coverage\n        env:\n          DATABASE_URL: postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/testdb","playwright:\n    name: üé≠ Playwright\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    services:\n      postgres:\n        image: postgres:12\n        env:\n          POSTGRES_USER: postgres\n          POSTGRES_PASSWORD: postgres\n          POSTGRES_DB: testdb\n        ports:\n          - 5432:5432\n    steps:\n      - name: ‚¨áÔ∏è Checkout repo\n        uses: actions/checkout@v3\n\n      - name: ‚éî Setup node\n        uses: actions/setup-node@v3\n        with:\n          node-version: 20\n\n      - name: üì• Download deps\n        uses: bahmutov/npm-install@v1\n\n      - name: üåê Install Playwright Browsers\n        run: npx playwright install --with-deps\n\n      - name: üõ† Setup Database\n        run: npm run prisma:wipe\n        env:\n          DATABASE_URL: postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/testdb\n\n      - name: üé≠ Playwright Run\n        run: npx playwright test\n        env:\n          DATABASE_URL: postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/testdb","- name: üì∏ Playwright Screenshots\n        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4\n        if: failure()\n        with:\n          name: playwright-report\n          path: playwright-report/\n          retention-days: 30\n‚ÄçNow every time you make a pull request to your app, it automatically runs your tests to ensure it works, runs TypeScript type checks and lints it, so that everyone contributes code with the same formatting.‚ÄçInterested in hiring skilled Next.js developers for your startup?

requirements","Before you begin, make sure your system meets the following requirements:\n\nNode.js 18.18 or later.\nmacOS, Windows (including WSL), or Linux.\n\nAutomatic installation","Node.js 18.18 or later.\nmacOS, Windows (including WSL), or Linux.\n\nAutomatic installation\n\n\n\n\n\nThe quickest way to create a new Next.js app is using create-next-app, which sets up everything automatically for you. To create a project, run:\nTerminalnpx create-next-app@latest\nOn installation, you'll see the following prompts:\nTerminalWhat is your project named? my-app\nWould you like to use TypeScript? No / Yes\nWould you like to use ESLint? No / Yes\nWould you like to use Tailwind CSS? No / Yes\nWould you like your code inside a `src/` directory? No / Yes\nWould you like to use App Router? (recommended) No / Yes\nWould you like to use Turbopack for `next dev`?  No / Yes\nWould you like to customize the import alias (`@/*` by default)? No / Yes\nWhat import alias would you like configured? @/*\nAfter the prompts, create-next-app will create a folder with your project name and install the required dependencies.\nManual installation","To manually create a new Next.js app, install the required packages:\nTerminalnpm install next@latest react@latest react-dom@latest\nThen, add the following scripts to your package.json file:\npackage.json{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"dev\": \"next dev\",\n    \"build\": \"next build\",\n    \"start\": \"next start\",\n    \"lint\": \"next lint\"\n  }\n}\nThese scripts refer to the different stages of developing an application:\n\nnext dev: Starts the development server.\nnext build: Builds the application for production.\nnext start: Starts the production server.\nnext lint: Runs ESLint.\n\nCreate the app directory","Create the app directory\n\n\n\n\nNext.js uses file-system routing, which means the routes in your application are determined by how you structure your files.Create an app folder. Then, inside app, create a layout.tsx file. This file is the root layout. It's required and must contain the <html> and <body> tags.app/layout.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptexport default function RootLayout({\n  children,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n}) {\n  return (\n    <html lang=\"en\">\n      <body>{children}</body>\n    </html>\n  )\n}Create a home page app/page.tsx with some initial content:app/page.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptexport default function Page() {\n  return <h1>Hello, Next.js!</h1>\n}Both layout.tsx and page.tsx will be rendered when the user visits the root of your application (/).\nGood to know:","If you forget to create the root layout, Next.js will automatically create this file when running the development server with next dev.\nYou can optionally use a src folder in the root of your project to separate your application's code from configuration files.\n\n\n\nCreate the public folder (optional)\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a public folder at the root of your project to store static assets such as images, fonts, etc. Files inside public can then be referenced by your code starting from the base URL (/).\nYou can then reference these assets using the root path (/).

To add TypeScript to your project, rename a file to .ts / .tsx and run next dev. Next.js will automatically install the necessary dependencies and add a tsconfig.json file with the recommended config options.\nIDE Plugin\n\n\n\n\nNext.js includes a custom TypeScript plugin and type checker, which VSCode and other code editors can use for advanced type-checking and auto-completion.You can enable the plugin in VS Code by:\nOpening the command palette (Ctrl/‚åò + Shift + P)\nSearching for \"TypeScript: Select TypeScript Version\"\nSelecting \"Use Workspace Version\"\n\nSee the TypeScript reference page for more information.\nSet up ESLint","See the TypeScript reference page for more information.\nSet up ESLint\n\n\n\n\n\nNext.js comes with built-in ESLint. It automatically installs the necessary packages and configures the proper settings when you create a new project with create-next-app.\nTo manually add ESLint to an existing project, add next lint as a script to package.json:\npackage.json{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"lint\": \"next lint\"\n  }\n}\nThen, run npm run lint and you will be guided through the installation and configuration process.\nTerminalnpm run lint\nYou'll see a prompt like this:\n\n? How would you like to configure ESLint?\n‚ùØ Strict (recommended)\nBase\nCancel\n\n\nStrict: Includes Next.js' base ESLint configuration along with a stricter Core Web Vitals rule-set. This is the recommended configuration for developers setting up ESLint for the first time.\nBase: Includes Next.js' base ESLint configuration.\nCancel: Skip configuration. Select this option if you plan on setting up your own custom ESLint configuration.","If Strict or Base are selected, Next.js will automatically install eslint and eslint-config-next as dependencies in your application and create an .eslintrc.json file in the root of your project that includes your selected configuration.\nYou can now run next lint every time you want to run ESLint to catch errors. Once ESLint has been set up, it will also automatically run during every build (next build). Errors will fail the build, while warnings will not.\nSee the ESLint Plugin page for more information.\nSet up Absolute Imports and Module Path Aliases","Next.js has in-built support for the \"paths\" and \"baseUrl\" options of tsconfig.json and jsconfig.json files.\nThese options allow you to alias project directories to absolute paths, making it easier and cleaner to import modules. For example:\n// Before\nimport { Button } from '../../../components/button'\n \n// After\nimport { Button } from '@/components/button'\nTo configure absolute imports, add the baseUrl configuration option to your tsconfig.json or jsconfig.json file. For example:\ntsconfig.json or jsconfig.json{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"baseUrl\": \"src/\"\n  }\n}\nIn addition to configuring the baseUrl path, you can use the \"paths\" option to \"alias\" module paths.\nFor example, the following configuration maps @/components/* to components/*:\ntsconfig.json or jsconfig.json{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"baseUrl\": \"src/\",\n    \"paths\": {\n      \"@/styles/*\": [\"styles/*\"],\n      \"@/components/*\": [\"components/*\"]\n    }\n  }\n}","\"@/styles/*\": [\"styles/*\"],\n      \"@/components/*\": [\"components/*\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\nEach of the \"paths\" are relative to the baseUrl location.PreviousGetting StartedNextProject StructureWas this helpful?","supported.Send\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResourcesDocsSupport

One way we can achieve this gem is by using quality web-building tools like NextJS- to enhance web performance such as lazy-image loading, Typescript- to keep code quality and avoid future spills and ChakraUI- to build accessibly user-friend interfaces. \nThis article will be working us through how we can combine these ‚Äúpowers‚Äù to build a ‚Äúsuperpowered‚Äù web application\nStep One- Initiate NextJS with Typescript: (Docs)\nIn our terminal, navigate to a directory to create a new project. Using your preferred package manager, let‚Äôs create a React project powered with NextJS and Typescript using this command: \nyarn create next-app --typescript or npx create-next-app@latest --ts. \nIn the process of running this command, the terminal will pop up a dialog asking us to name our new project. Let‚Äôs call it doggies (A Dog-interest website) and we are golden!","PS: The --ts or --typescript is a flag to tell the package manager to initiate a React project with Typescript.","Step Two- Install ChakraUI: (Docs)\nAfter successfully creating our project that is powered with NextJS and Typescript, let‚Äôs now install ChakraUI. Before running the command to install ChakraUI, navigate to the root of the project, then go ahead to install ChakraUI using this command: \nyarn add @chakra-ui/react @emotion/react@^11 @emotion/styled@^11 framer-motion@^6\nor\nnpm i @chakra-ui/react @emotion/react@^11 @emotion/styled@^11 framer-motion@^6 \nAnd that‚Äôs it! ChakraUI is now available on our project. To have full access to the goodies that comes with ChakraUI we need to do one last thing and that takes us to step number 3.\n\n\nStep Three- Activate the power of ChakraUI.\nTo do this, we need to access the _app.tsx file inside our Pages folder of our project and wrap its return components in a ChakraProvider Component. \nThis is what the file looks like by default:\n\n\nimport type { AppProps } from 'next/app'","import type { AppProps } from 'next/app'\n\nfunction MyApp({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) {\n  return <Component {...pageProps} />\n}\n\nexport default MyApp\n\n\n\nEnter fullscreen mode\n\n\nExit fullscreen mode\n\n\n\n\n\nSo now let‚Äôs import ChakraProvider and use it as a wrapper before returning the Components. Our file should now look like this:\n\n\nimport '../styles/globals.css'\nimport type { AppProps } from 'next/app'\nimport { ChakraProvider } from '@chakra-ui/react'\n\nfunction MyApp({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) {\n  return (\n    <ChakraProvider>\n      <Component {...pageProps} />\n    </ChakraProvider>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default MyApp;\n\n\n\nEnter fullscreen mode\n\n\nExit fullscreen mode","export default MyApp;\n\n\n\nEnter fullscreen mode\n\n\nExit fullscreen mode\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd there it is! Our application is now powered with NextJS, Typescript and ChakraUI. \nTo see the smooth user interfaces your can create with ChakraUI you can check the documentation of all its components here. \nI‚Äôll be writing an article about why this setup is my favourite and what opportunities this gives us, until then, have a good day and stay well!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Top comments (1)\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonal\nTrusted User\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Create template\n      \nTemplates let you quickly answer FAQs or store snippets for re-use.\n\n\n\nSubmit\nPreview\nDismiss\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCollapse\n\n\nExpand\n\n\n\n\n\n\n¬†\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInfo\n\n\n\n      Comment hidden by post author - thread only accessible via permalink\n  \n\n\nDustinSeals\n\n\n\n      DustinSeals\n      \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      DustinSeals\n      \n    \n\n\n\nFollow","DustinSeals\n\n\n\n      DustinSeals\n      \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      DustinSeals\n      \n    \n\n\n\nFollow\n\n\n    I am Dustin .

For example if the user sets their computer to dark mode by default, Chakra-UI will default to dark mode.\nComposibility: Components can be created from the Chakra-UI ones or if needed custom components can be created with ease.\nTypescript Support: Chakra-UI is written in TypeScript and provides class types for easy integration.\n\n\n\n\n\n  What we will be making\n\nIn this tutorial we will use Chakra-UI to create a simple user list/profile page. \nWe will also integrate a toggler to toggle between light and dark mode.\nYou will learn how to set up a basic Next.js application with Chakra-UI integration.\n\n\n\n\n  Creating the Next.js application and installing the dependencies","Creating the Next.js application and installing the dependencies\n\nFirst we need to create a new Next.js app and install the dependencies needed for the example.\nThe Next.js app can be created via the following command:\n\n\n\nnpx create-next-app@latest\n\n\n\n\n\nEnter fullscreen mode\n\n\nExit fullscreen mode\n\n\n\n\n\nThis will set up the Next.js project automatically for you.\nNext we need to install Chakra-ui which can be done via the following command:\n\n\n\nyarn add @chakra-ui/react @emotion/react@^11 @emotion/styled@^11 framer-motion@^4 @chakra-ui/icons\n\n\n\n\n\nEnter fullscreen mode\n\n\nExit fullscreen mode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Creating fake Users\n\nNext we will need some fake users to actually populate the page. \nCreate a \"data\" folder in the root directory and create a \"users.js\" file and populate it with the following data: (feel free to use your own custom data but be careful of the parameter names):\nhttps://github.com/ethand91/nextjs-chakra-sample/blob/main/data/users.js\n\n\n\n\n  Creating the components","Creating the components\n\nNext we need to create the components needed for the sample page, create a new folder called \"components\" and within that create a \"TopBar\" folder.\nWithin the TopBar folder create a new file called \"index.js\" and populate it with the following contents:\n\n\n\nimport {\n  Box,\n  Button,\n  useColorMode\n} from '@chakra-ui/react';\nimport { MoonIcon, SunIcon } from '@chakra-ui/icons';\n\nfunction TopBar() {\n  const { colorMode, toggleColorMode } = useColorMode();\n  const ColorModeIcon = colorMode === 'light' ? SunIcon : MoonIcon;\n\n  return (\n    <Box width=\"100%\" padding=\"1\" backgroundColor=\"purple.700\">\n      <Box maxWidth=\"container.xl\" margin=\"auto\">\n        <Button\n          aria-label=\"ui theme\"\n          leftIcon={ <ColorModeIcon /> }\n          onClick={ toggleColorMode }\n          size=\"xs\"\n          marginRight=\"2\"\n          borderRadius=\"sm\"\n        >\n          Toggle Theme\n        </Button>\n      </Box>\n    </Box>\n  );  \n};\n\nexport default TopBar;","export default TopBar;\n\n\n\n\n\nEnter fullscreen mode\n\n\nExit fullscreen mode\n\n\n\n\n\nHere we create a simple top bar for the application, we give it a background color of purple and also provide a button that allows the user to toggle between light/dark mode using Chakra-UI.\nNext we need a component to display the users, so create a new \"UserCard\" directory and within that directory create an \"index.js\" file and populate it with the following contents:\n\n\n\nimport Link from 'next/link';\nimport {\n  Box,\n  Text,\n  Avatar,\n  Center,\n  VStack,\n  useColorModeValue\n} from '@chakra-ui/react';","function UserCard(props) {\n  return (\n    <Link href={ `/users/${props.username}` } passHref>\n      <VStack\n        spacing=\"4\"\n        borderRadius=\"md\"\n        boxShadow=\"x1\"\n        padding=\"5\"\n        backgroundColor={\n          useColorModeValue('gray.50', 'gray.700')\n        }\n      >   \n        <Center>\n          <Avatar size=\"lg\" src={ props.avatar } />\n        </Center>\n        <Center>\n          <Box textAlign=\"center\">\n            <Text fontWeight=\"bold\" fontSize=\"xl\">\n              { props.first_name } { props.last_name }\n            </Text>\n            <Text fontSize=\"xs\">{ props.job_title }</Text>\n          </Box>\n        </Center>\n      </VStack>\n    </Link>\n  );  \n};\n\nexport default UserCard;\n\n\n\n\n\nEnter fullscreen mode\n\n\nExit fullscreen mode\n\n\n\n\n\nThis card will link to the user details page, using Chakra-UI we are easily able to center contents using \"Center\". We also use Avatar to easily display the user's profile picture.\nThats the components created.","Creating the Pages\n\nNext we need to start working on the pages.\nWe will be overriding the default Next.js document which can be done by creating a \"_document.js\" inside the pages directory. \nCreate the file and populate it with the following:\n\n\n\nimport { ColorModeScript } from '@chakra-ui/react';\nimport NextDocument, {\n  Html,\n  Head,\n  Main,\n  NextScript\n} from 'next/document';\nimport { extendTheme } from '@chakra-ui/react';\n\nconst config = { \n  useSystemColorMode: true\n};\n\nconst theme = extendTheme({ config }); \n\nexport default class Document extends NextDocument {\n  render () {\n    return (\n      <Html lang=\"en\">\n        <Head />\n        <body>\n          <ColorModeScript\n            initialColorMode={ theme.config.initialColorMode }\n          />\n          <Main />\n          <NextScript />\n        </body>\n      </Html>\n    );  \n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nEnter fullscreen mode\n\n\nExit fullscreen mode","Enter fullscreen mode\n\n\nExit fullscreen mode\n\n\n\n\n\nThe reason for overriding the default layout is because we want to apply both light/dark theme to the entire page.\nNext we need to apply Chara-UI to the application so open up pages/_app.js and change the contents to the following:\n\n\n\nimport { ChakraProvider, Box } from '@chakra-ui/react';\nimport TopBar from './../components/TopBar';\n\nfunction MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {\n  return (\n    <ChakraProvider>\n      <TopBar />\n      <Box maxWidth=\"container.xl\" margin=\"auto\">\n        <Component { ...pageProps} />\n      </Box>\n    </ChakraProvider>\n  );  \n}\n\nexport default MyApp\n\n\n\n\n\nEnter fullscreen mode\n\n\nExit fullscreen mode\n\n\n\n\n\nHere we bascially tell Next.js to use the Chara-UI provider and make sure everypage has our custom TopBar.\nNext we need to edit the pages/index.js to contain the following contents:\n\n\n\nimport {\n  Box,\n  Grid,\n  Text,\n  GridItem\n} from '@chakra-ui/react';","import {\n  Box,\n  Grid,\n  Text,\n  GridItem\n} from '@chakra-ui/react';\n\nimport UserCard from './../components/UserCard';\nimport users from './../data/users';\n\nexport default function Home() {\n  return (\n    <Box>\n      <Text\n        fontSize=\"xxx-large\"\n        fontWeight=\"extrabold\"\n        textAlign=\"center\"\n        marginTop=\"9\"\n      >   \n        Users\n      </Text>\n\n      <Grid\n        gridTemplateColumns={ ['1fr', 'repeat(2, 1fr)', 'repeat(3, 1fr)'] }\n        gridGap=\"10\"\n        padding=\"10\"\n      >   \n        {\n          users.map((user) => (\n            <GridItem key={ user.id }>\n              <UserCard { ...user } />\n            </GridItem>\n          ))\n        }\n      </Grid>\n    </Box>\n  );  \n}\n\n\n\n\n\nEnter fullscreen mode\n\n\nExit fullscreen mode","Enter fullscreen mode\n\n\nExit fullscreen mode\n\n\n\n\n\nHere we basically list all the users using Chakra-UI's Grid component. The \"gridTemplateColumns\" allows us to set the sizes for small screens, medium screens and large screens. For example if you view the page on a large screen each row will have 3 users, however if you view it on a mobile device each row will only have one user.\nFeel free to run the project using:\n\n\n\nnpm run dev\n\n\n\n\n\nEnter fullscreen mode\n\n\nExit fullscreen mode\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you access the page (https://localhost:3000), you should see the following page:\n\nIf you prefer light mode you should see the following:","If you prefer light mode you should see the following:\n\nFeel free to play with the toggle button. If you try clicking on a user you will be greeted with a 404 not found response so let's create the user profile page!\nCreate a \"users\" folder inside the pages folder and create the \"[username].js\". (Note if you're using a terminal like me you may need to escape the brackets with a backslash).\nNow fill the file with the following contents:\n\n\n\nmport Link from 'next/link';\nimport {\n  Avatar,\n  Box,\n  Center,\n  Text,\n  Image,\n  Button,\n  Flex,\n  useColorModeValue\n} from '@chakra-ui/react';\n\nimport users from './../../data/users';\n\nexport function getStaticPaths() {\n  const paths = users.map((user) => ({\n    params: {\n      username: user.username\n    }   \n  }));\n\n  return {\n    paths,\n    fallback: false\n  };  \n}\n\nexport function getStaticProps({ params }) {\n  const { username } = params;","export function getStaticProps({ params }) {\n  const { username } = params;\n\n  return { \n    props: {\n      user: users.find((user) => user.username === username)\n    }   \n  };  \n};\n\nfunction UserPage({ user }) {\n  return (\n    <Center\n      marginTop={ ['0', '0', '8' ] }\n      boxShadow=\"lg\"\n      minHeight=\"fit-content\"\n    >\n      <Box>\n        <Box position=\"relative\">\n          <Image src={user.cover_image} width=\"fit-content\" height=\"250px\" objectFit=\"cover\" />\n\n          <Flex\n            alignItems=\"flex-end\"\n            position=\"absolute\"\n            top=\"0\"\n            left=\"0\"\n            backgroundColor={\n              useColorModeValue('blackAlpha.400', 'blackAlpha.600')\n            }\n            width=\"100%\"\n            height=\"100%\"\n            padding=\"8\"\n            color=\"white\"","<Avatar size=\"lg\" src={ user.avatar } />\n            <Box marginLeft=\"6\">\n              <Text as=\"h1\" fontSize=\"xx-large\" fontWeight=\"bold\">\n                { user.first_name } { user.last_name }\n              </Text>\n              <Text as=\"p\" fontSize=\"large\" lineHeight=\"1.5\">\n                { user.job_title }\n              </Text>\n            </Box>\n          </Flex>\n        </Box>\n        <Box\n          maxW=\"container.xl\"\n          margin=\"auto\"\n          padding=\"8\"\n          backgroundColor={\n            useColorModeValue('white', 'gray.700')\n          }\n        >\n          <Text as=\"p\">{ user.description }</Text>\n          <Link href=\"/\" passHref>\n            <Button marginTop=\"8\" colorScheme=\"whatsapp\" as=\"a\">\n              Back to all users\n            </Button>\n          </Link>\n        </Box>\n      </Box>\n    </Center>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default UserPage;\n\n\n\n\n\nEnter fullscreen mode\n\n\nExit fullscreen mode","export default UserPage;\n\n\n\n\n\nEnter fullscreen mode\n\n\nExit fullscreen mode\n\n\n\n\n\nPhew! Here we use \"getStaticPaths\" to tell Next.js we need to render a new page for each user in the user's array.\nWe also tell Next.js to display the default 404 page if the requested user is not found.\nChakra-UI allows us to easily center the contents. This page basically displays the contents of the user and provides a button to go back using a Chakra-UI feature.\nAll done fire up the dev server and load up https://localhost:3000 in the browser. \nOnce loading try clicking on a user you should see the following page:\n\n\nAll done! üòé\n\n\n\n\n  Conclusion\n\nHere I have demonstrated how to use Next.js with Chakra-UI.

Even if you‚Äôre working on an existing project, you will discover some hard-earned insights that you can apply to your app today.Let me take you by the hand and show you all the steps and packages that you want to set up and explain to you why they‚Äôre useful, so your app scales smoothly.Initialize Your ProjectBegin by creating a new","you why they‚Äôre useful, so your app scales smoothly.Initialize Your ProjectBegin by creating a new Next.js project.npx create-next-app@latestIt may ask you if it can install the latest create-next-app version, just hit yes.Need to install the following packages:create-next-app@15.0.0Ok to proceed?

Discuss choices like using semicolons, quote styles, and tabs versus spaces with your team.Then use tools to enforce your style guide and format code automatically.There are two tools for that: Prettier and ESLint.PrettierPrettier is an opinionated code formatter that eliminates style","that: Prettier and ESLint.PrettierPrettier is an opinionated code formatter that eliminates style discussions during code reviews.Install Prettier together with its Tailwind plugin.npm install --save-dev prettier prettier-plugin-tailwindcssCreate aprettier.config.js file with your preferred rules.module.exports = {  arrowParens: 'avoid',  bracketSameLine: false,  bracketSpacing: true,  htmlWhitespaceSensitivity: 'css',  insertPragma: false,  jsxSingleQuote: false,  plugins: ['prettier-plugin-tailwindcss'],  printWidth: 80,  proseWrap: 'always',  quoteProps: 'as-needed',  requirePragma: false,  semi: true,  singleQuote: true,  tabWidth: 2,  trailingComma: 'all',  useTabs: false,};Add a formatting script to your package.json.\"format\": \"prettier --write .\",Run the formatter to apply your style.$ npm run format> nextjs-for-production@0.1.0 format> prettier --write .next.config.mjs 4ms (unchanged)package-lock.json 54ms (unchanged)package.json 1ms (unchanged)postcss.config.mjs 2ms","4ms (unchanged)package-lock.json 54ms (unchanged)package.json 1ms (unchanged)postcss.config.mjs 2ms (unchanged)README.md 20ms (unchanged)src/app/globals.css 17ms (unchanged)src/app/layout.tsx 30ms (unchanged)src/app/page.tsx 11ms (unchanged)tailwind.config.ts 2ms (unchanged)tsconfig.json 2ms (unchanged)Your files are now ‚Äúprettier‚Äù, but you also want to use ESLint.ESLintESLint can scan your code for both stylistic and logical issues.

For detailed descriptions, visit their respective GitHub pages.But in short, they enforce coding standards, organize imports, and ensure correct use of modern JavaScript features. Since ESLint and Prettier can conflict, this setup makes them work together smoothly. The plugins also help prevent bugs and keep styles consistent,","makes them work together smoothly. The plugins also help prevent bugs and keep styles consistent, especially with tools like Vitest and Playwright.Add a linting script to your package.json.\"lint:fix\": \"next lint --fix\",Run it to format all files according to your new rules.$ npm run lint:fix> nextjs-for-production@0.1.0 lint:fix> next lint --fix‚úî No ESLint warnings or errorsIf you get a TypeScript version warning, you can ignore that.Note: As of this article‚Äôs writing, ESLint 9 is available, but this tutorial uses ESLint 8 because many plugins do not yet support the latest version.CommitlintWhen collaborating with a large team, it‚Äôs also helpful to enforce consistent commit messages to keep the project history clear. By choosing the right standards, you can automate changelog and release generation with correct semantic versioning.Install Commitlint and its necessary configurations.

A facade is a design pattern where you provide a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.Create a file that contains all facades related to your user profile model features/user-profile/user-profile-model.ts.import { UserProfile } from '@prisma/client';import prisma from '@/lib/prisma';export async function retrieveUserProfileFromDatabaseByEmail(  email: UserProfile['email'],) {  return await","function retrieveUserProfileFromDatabaseByEmail(  email: UserProfile['email'],) {  return await prisma.userProfile.findUnique({ where: { email } });}There are two main reasons for using facades.Increase vendor resistance ‚Äî You can switch third-party providers easily. For example, you might switch from Firebase to Supabase or vice versa. Instead of updating your whole codebase to reflect the change, you only update the facade.Simplify your code ‚Äî A facade can reduce the code you need to write in your application because it reduces the API to your specific application needs. Simultaneously, it makes your code easier to understand because you can give the facade descriptive names.Then use your facade in your server component.import { retrieveUserProfileFromDatabaseByEmail } from '@/features/user-profiles/user-profiles-model';import {  Card,  CardContent,  CardHeader,  CardTitle,} from '@/components/ui/card';export default async function Dashboard() {  const user =    await","from '@/components/ui/card';export default async function Dashboard() {  const user =    await retrieveUserProfileFromDatabaseByEmail('jan@reactsquad.io');  return (    <Card className=\"max-w-md mx-auto\">      <CardHeader>        <CardTitle>User Profile</Card.Title>      </CardHeader>      <CardContent>        {user ? (          <ul>            <li>Name: {user.name}</li>            <li>Email: {user.email}</li>          </ul>        ) : (          <p>User not found.</p>        )}      </CardContent>    </Card>  );}Vercel PostgresYou can use Vercel Postgres for your production deployment. They have an easy to follow guide, which you can check out in the Vercel documentation. But here are the steps real quick for your convenience.To set up a database in your Vercel project, follow these steps:Go to the Storage tab and click the Create Database button.When the Browse Storage modal opens, choose Postgres and click Continue.For creating a new database:In the dialog box, type","modal opens, choose Postgres and click Continue.For creating a new database:In the dialog box, type sample_postgres_db (or a name you prefer) in the Store Name field. Ensure the name has only alphanumeric characters, \"_\" or \"-\", and does not exceed 32 characters.Choose a region. For lower latency, select a region close to your function region, which is US East by default.Click Create.Then you‚Äôll need to add POSTGRES_URL_NON_POOLING to the datasource in your Prisma schema.datasource db {  provider  = \"postgresql\"  // Uses connection pooling  url       = env(\"DATABASE_URL\")  // Uses direct connection, ‚ö†Ô∏è make sure to keep this to `POSTGRES_URL_NON_POOLING`  // or you'll have dangling databases from migrations  directUrl = env(\"POSTGRES_URL_NON_POOLING\")}Vercel uses connection poolers, which manage a pool of database connections that can be reused by different parts of an application, rather than establishing a new connection for each database request. The directUrl property is used to","than establishing a new connection for each database request. The directUrl property is used to ensure operations requiring direct database access, such as migrations, can bypass the connection pooler for reliable execution.You can get the environment variables for your Vercel database by pulling them from Vercel.vercel env pull .envPlaywrightYou also want to use E2E tests because E2E tests give you the most confidence that your app works as intended.

In this article, I'll share all the lessons I've learned through countless iterations.Whether you're part of a small team of one, two, or three developers, or you work on a massive Next.js project with multiple teams on the same codebase, it's critical to get the foundation of your app right from the start. Even if you're working on an existing project, you will discover some hard-earned insights that you can apply to your app today.Let me take you by the hand and show you all the steps and packages that you want to set up and explain to you why they're useful, so your app scales","and packages that you want to set up and explain to you why they're useful, so your app scales smoothly.Initialize Your ProjectBegin by creating a new Next.js project.npx create-next-app@latest","It may ask you if it can install the latest create-next-app version, just hit yes.Need to install the following packages:\ncreate-next-app@15.0.0\nOk to proceed? (y)\nAnd then configure your project by hitting yes on everything (TypeScript, Tailwind, app router).‚úî **What is your project named?** ‚Ä¶ reactsquad-production\n‚úî **Would you like to use** **TypeScript****?** ‚Ä¶ No / Yes\nYes\n‚úî **Would you like to use** **ESLint****?** ‚Ä¶ No / Yes\nYes\n‚úî **Would you like to use** **Tailwind CSS****?** ‚Ä¶ No / Yes\nYes\n‚úî **Would you like to use** **`src/` directory****?** ‚Ä¶ No / Yes\nYes\n‚úî **Would you like to use** **App Router****? (recommended)** ‚Ä¶ No / Yes\nYes\n‚úî **Would you like to customize the default** **import alias** **(@/*)?** ‚Ä¶ No / No\nThen change into the directory of your project and open it in your favorite editor.$ cd nextjs-for-production\n~/dev/nextjs-for-production (main) ü§Ø\n$ cursor .","~/dev/nextjs-for-production (main) ü§Ø\n$ cursor .\nRun The Development ServerYou want to verify that your setup worked.Run npm run dev to start the development server.Visit http://localhost:3000 to view your application.Type Checks With TypeScriptYour project has TypeScript already configured, but you also want to add an explicit command to your package.json that checks all your files for type errors.\"type-check\": \"tsc -b\"","You're going to use this command later together with other automated static analysis checks.Code FormattingWhen you collaborate with a large team on a project, it's important to unify the way that everyone writes code. Discuss choices like using semicolons, quote styles, and tabs versus spaces with your team.Then use tools to enforce your style guide and format code automatically.There are two tools for that: Prettier and ESLint.PrettierPrettier is an opinionated code formatter that eliminates style discussions during code reviews.Install Prettier together with its Tailwind plugin.npm install --save-dev prettier prettier-plugin-tailwindcss\nCreate a prettier.config.js file with your preferred rules.module.exports = {\n  arrowParens: 'avoid',\n  bracketSameLine: false,\n  bracketSpacing: true,\n  htmlWhitespaceSensitivity: 'css',\n  insertPragma: false,\n  jsxSingleQuote: false,\n  plugins: ['prettier-plugin-tailwindcss'],\n  printWidth: 80,\n  proseWrap: 'always',\n  quoteProps: 'as-needed',","printWidth: 80,\n  proseWrap: 'always',\n  quoteProps: 'as-needed',\n  requirePragma: false,\n  semi: true,\n  singleQuote: true,\n  tabWidth: 2,\n  trailingComma: 'all',\n  useTabs: false,\n};\nAdd a formatting script to your package.json.\"format\": \"prettier --write .\",\nRun the formatter to apply your style.$ npm run format","> nextjs-for-production@0.1.0 format\n> prettier --write .","next.config.mjs 4ms (unchanged)\npackage-lock.json 54ms (unchanged)\npackage.json 1ms (unchanged)\npostcss.config.mjs 2ms (unchanged)\nREADME.md 20ms (unchanged)\nsrc/app/globals.css 17ms (unchanged)\nsrc/app/layout.tsx 30ms (unchanged)\nsrc/app/page.tsx 11ms (unchanged)\ntailwind.config.ts 2ms (unchanged)\ntsconfig.json 2ms (unchanged)\nYour files are now \"prettier\", but you also want to use ESLint.ESLintESLint can scan your code for both stylistic and logical issues. Install ESLint and its plugins, like unicorn, playwright and import sort.npm install --save-dev @typescript-eslint/parser eslint-plugin-unicorn eslint-plugin-import eslint-plugin-playwright eslint-config-prettier eslint-plugin-prettier eslint-plugin-simple-import-sort\nUpdate your .eslintrc.json.{\n  \"extends\": [\n    \"next/core-web-vitals\",\n    \"plugin:unicorn/recommended\",\n    \"plugin:import/recommended\",\n    \"plugin:playwright/recommended\",\n    \"plugin:prettier/recommended\"\n  ],\n  \"plugins\": [\"simple-import-sort\"],\n  \"rules\": {","\"plugin:prettier/recommended\"\n  ],\n  \"plugins\": [\"simple-import-sort\"],\n  \"rules\": {\n    \"simple-import-sort/exports\": \"error\",\n    \"simple-import-sort/imports\": \"error\",\n    \"unicorn/no-array-callback-reference\": \"off\",\n    \"unicorn/no-array-for-each\": \"off\",\n    \"unicorn/no-array-reduce\": \"off\",\n    \"unicorn/prevent-abbreviations\": [\n      \"error\",\n      {\n        \"allowList\": {\n          \"e2e\": true\n        },\n        \"replacements\": {\n          \"props\": false,\n          \"ref\": false,\n          \"params\": false\n        }\n      }\n    ]\n  },\n  \"overrides\": [\n    {\n      \"files\": [\"*.js\"],\n      \"rules\": {\n        \"unicorn/prefer-module\": \"off\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}","\"rules\": {\n        \"unicorn/prefer-module\": \"off\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\nThis tutorial's plugins offer different functions. For detailed descriptions, visit their respective GitHub pages.But in short, they enforce coding standards, organize imports, and ensure correct use of modern JavaScript features. Since ESLint and Prettier can conflict, this setup makes them work together smoothly. The plugins also help prevent bugs and keep styles consistent, especially with tools like Vitest and Playwright.Add a linting script to your package.json.\"lint:fix\": \"next lint --fix\",\nRun it to format all files according to your new rules.$ npm run lint:fix","> nextjs-for-production@0.1.0 lint:fix\n> next lint --fix","‚úî No ESLint warnings or errors\nIf you get a TypeScript version warning, you can ignore that.Note: As of this article's writing, ESLint 9 is available, but this tutorial uses ESLint 8 because many plugins do not yet support the latest version.CommitlintWhen collaborating with a large team, it's also helpful to enforce consistent commit messages to keep the project history clear. By choosing the right standards, you can automate changelog and release generation with correct semantic versioning.Install Commitlint and its necessary configurations. This includes Husky, which helps manage Git hooks.npm install --save-dev @commitlint/cli@latest @commitlint/config-conventional@latest husky@latest\nInitialize Husky in your project to set up the basic configuration.npx husky-init && npm install\nAdd hooks to automate linting and type checking before each commit, and customize your commit message workflow.npx husky add .husky/pre-commit 'npm run lint && npm run type-check'","npx husky add .husky/prepare-commit-msg 'exec < /dev/tty && npx cz --hook || true'\nThe pre-commit hook runs after git commit, but before the commit message is finalized and runs linting and type-checking on your code.The prepare-commit-msg hook runs after git commit is initiated but before the commit message editor opens. It runs commitizen CLI to let you craft conventional commit messages. You'll learn how to use this hook in a bit.Remove the line that says npm test from .husky/_/pre-commit.Make sure these scripts are executable.chmod a+x .husky/pre-commit\nchmod a+x .husky/prepare-commit-msg\nHere, chmod stands for \"change mode.\" This command allows you to change the access permissions or modes of a file or directory in Unix and Unix-like operating systems. The argument a+x adds execute permissions for all users.Install Commitizen, which provides a CLI for crafting conventional commit messages.npm install --save-dev commitizen cz-conventional-changelog","Configure Commitizen in your package.json to use the conventional changelog standard.\"config\": {\n  \"commitizen\": {\n    \"path\": \"cz-conventional-changelog\"\n  }\n},\nThe conventional changeloge standard is a specification for adding human and machine-readable meaning to commit messages. It is designed to automate the producing of changelogs and releases based on the Git history of your project.A future article will explain this standard in detail. It's included in this tutorial because getting it right from the start is important. You can use it and benefit from it without needing an in-depth understanding.Create your commitlint.config.cjs file with rules that suit your team's needs. This setup ensures your commit messages are consistent and relevant to the changes made.const config = {\n  extends: ['@commitlint/config-conventional'],\n  rules: {\n    'references-empty': [1, 'never'],\n    'footer-max-line-length': [0, 'always'],\n    'body-max-line-length': [0, 'always'],\n  },\n};","module.exports = config;\nRun the following command to start crafting your commit messages using a guided CLI.$ git add --all\n$ npx cz\ncz-cli@4.3.0, cz-conventional-changelog@3.3.0","?

It has the following benefits:Scalability: Large applications are easier to scale and maintain because each feature acts like a mini-application. You avoid scrolling up and down in your file list to find all the files you need.Collaboration: Developers can focus on specific features without disrupting others‚Äô work.Onboarding: New developers understand the project structure faster, as all files for a feature are in one place.Refactoring: Updating a feature is streamlined since all its elements are grouped together.Modularity: Features can be reused, shared, or turned into standalone packages more easily.Micro-frontends: If your application ever grows to 30 or more engineers, it is easy to refactor to micro-frontends.Here is a more concrete example.src/","‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app/\n‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ...\n‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ (group)/\n‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ about/\n‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ page.tsx\n‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ settings/\n‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ page.tsx\n‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ layout.tsx\n‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dashboard/\n‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ page.tsx\n‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ layout.tsx\n‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ layout.tsx\n‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ page.tsx\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/\n‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ...\n‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ header/\n‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ header-component.tsx\n‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ header-component.test.ts\n‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ header.module.css\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ features/\n‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ...\n‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ todos/\n‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ...\n‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ todos-component.tsx\n‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ todos-component.test.ts\n‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ todos-container.ts\n‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ todos-reducer.ts\n‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ todos-reducer.test.ts\n‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ todos-styles.ts\n‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ user/\n‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ...\n‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ user-reducer.ts\n‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ user-reducer.test.ts\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hocs/\n‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ...\n‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ with-layout.tsx\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hooks/\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ redux/\n‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ root-reducer.ts\n‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ root-saga.ts\n‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ store.ts\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ...\n‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ middleware.ts","‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ redux/\n‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ root-reducer.ts\n‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ root-saga.ts\n‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ store.ts\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ...\n‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ middleware.ts\nThis example shows you how you can organize your src/ directory. Generally, everything is grouped by feature. Tests files live next to their respective implementation files. But anything that is shared by multiple features is then grouped in general folders, such as components/ or HOCs/ or hooks/. Shared setup for state management - in this example for Redux - lives in a redux/ folder.Some people also like to group by feature within the app/ folder. Here is how that would look like.src/\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app/\n‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ...\n‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ (group)/\n‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dashboard/\n‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/\n‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dashboard-header.tsx\n‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dashboard-header.test.ts\n‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dashboard-widgets.tsx\n‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ dashboard-widgets.test.ts\n‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ services/\n‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ fetch-data.ts\n‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ fetch-data.test.ts\n‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ auth-service.ts\n‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ auth-service.test.ts","‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ auth-service.ts\n‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ auth-service.test.ts\n‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ page.tsx\n‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ layout.ts\n‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ layout.tsx\n‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ page.tsx\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ...\n‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ middleware.ts\nIn this tutorial, you're going to group files by feature in the first way.VitestIf you want to avoid bugs and prevent regressions, you need to write tests. Vitest is a great choice because it has the same API as the most popular framework, which is Jest, but it runs faster.Install Vitest.npm install -D vitest\nAnd configure a testing command in your package.json.\"test\": \"vitest --reporter=verbose\",\nThen create an example.test.ts file and write a short test to check to check Vitest works.import { describe, expect, test } from 'vitest';","describe('example', () => {\n  test('given a passing test: passes', () => {\n    expect(1).toStrictEqual(1);\n  });\n});\nIt should pass.$ npm test\n\n> nextjs-for-production@0.1.0 test\n> vitest --reporter=verbose\n\n\n DEV  v2.0.5 /Users/jan/dev/nextjs-for-production\n\n ‚úì src/example.test.ts (1)\n   ‚úì example (1)\n     ‚úì given a passing test: passes\n\n Test Files  1 passed (1)\n      Tests  1 passed (1)\n   Start at  14:06:24\n   Duration  203ms (transform 20ms, setup 0ms, collect 17ms, tests 1ms, environment 0ms, prepare 56ms)","PASS  Waiting for file changes...\n       press h to show help, press q to quit\nIf you want to learn how you can write better tests, check out this article that teaches you 12 evergreen testing principles that every senior developer should know.React Testing LibraryYou also want to write tests for your React components. For that, you can use the React Testing Library, often abbreviated as RTL.npm install --save-dev @testing-library/react @testing-library/dom @testing-library/jest-dom @testing-library/user-event @types/react @types/react-dom happy-dom @vitejs/plugin-react vite-tsconfig-paths\nThen, create a vitest.config.ts file.import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react';\nimport tsconfigPaths from 'vite-tsconfig-paths';\nimport { defineConfig } from 'vitest/config';","export default defineConfig({\n  plugins: [react(), tsconfigPaths()],\n  server: {\n    port: 3000,\n  },\n  test: {\n    environment: 'happy-dom',\n    globals: true,\n    setupFiles: ['./src/tests/setup-test-environment.ts'],\n    include: ['./src/**/*.{spec,test}.{js,mjs,cjs,ts,mts,cts,jsx,tsx}'],\n    watch: {\n      ignored: [\n        String.raw`.*\\\\/node_modules\\\\/.*`,\n        String.raw`.*\\\\/build\\\\/.*`,\n        String.raw`.*\\\\/postgres-data\\\\/.*`,\n      ],\n    },\n    coverage: {\n      reporter: ['text', 'json', 'html'],\n    },\n  },\n});\nIt sets up the development server, specifies testing parameters like that the ¬†environment is happy-dom and file paths, and defines coverage report formats.And create a file called src/tests/setup-test-environment.ts to set up your test environment.import '@testing-library/jest-dom/vitest';\n\n// See <https://reactjs.org/blog/2022/03/08/react-18-upgrade-guide.html#configuring-your-testing-environment>.","// @ts-ignore\nglobalThis.IS_REACT_ACT_ENVIRONMENT = true;\nThe first line imports additional assertions, which extend Vitest's built-in assertions, allowing you to more easily test DOM nodes. For example, you can check if an element is visible, has a certain text content, or includes specific attributes.The global environment flag ensures that tests involving state updates work as expected without timing issues.Next, you want to set up a custom render method src/tests/react-test-utils.tsx./* eslint-disable import/export */\nimport type { RenderOptions } from '@testing-library/react';\nimport { render } from '@testing-library/react';\nimport type { ReactElement } from 'react';\n\nconst customRender = (\n  ui: ReactElement,\n  options?: Omit<RenderOptions, 'queries'>,\n) =>\n  render(ui, {\n    wrapper: ({ children }) => <>{children}</>,\n    ...options,\n  });\n\n// re-export everything\nexport * from '@testing-library/react';","// re-export everything\nexport * from '@testing-library/react';\n\n// override render method\nexport { customRender as render };\nexport { default as userEvent } from '@testing-library/user-event';\nYou can use this to wrap your code in providers, for example, when using Redux, or adding layouts and styling.Make sure your configuration worked by writing a test for a React component.import { describe, expect, test } from 'vitest';\n\nimport { render, screen } from '@/tests/react-test-utils';\n\nfunction MyReactComponent() {\n  return <div>My React Component</div>;\n}\n\ndescribe('MyReactComponent', () => {\n  test('given no props: renders a text', () => {\n    render(<MyReactComponent />);","expect(screen.getByText('My React Component')).toBeInTheDocument();\n  });\n});\nYou import render and screen from your test utils file instead of from RTL directly.toBeInTheDocument() is one of those special assertions that you configured earlier in your test environment setup file.It should pass, too. ‚úì src/features/example.test.tsx (1)\n   ‚úì MyReactComponent (1)\n     ‚úì given no props: renders a text\n\n Test Files  1 passed (1)\n      Tests  1 passed (1)\n   Start at  09:33:32\n   Duration  402ms (transform 24ms, setup 55ms, collect 87ms, tests 9ms, environment 80ms, prepare 45ms)","PASS  Waiting for file changes...\n       press h to show help, press q to quit\nStylingNow let's talk about styling.

The negotiator package helps your app to figure out what type of content (like language or format) your user's browser can handle best, based on the information the browser sends.You'll also need to install the TypeScript types for the negotiator package.npm install --save-dev @types/negotiator\nThen, create your i18n config in a new file at src/features/internationalization/i18n-config.ts.export const i18n = {\n  defaultLocale: 'en-US',\n  locales: ['en-US'],\n} as const;","export type Locale = (typeof i18n)['locales'][number];\nUse that i18n config, in your localization-middleware at src/features/internationalization/localization-middleware.ts.import { match } from '@formatjs/intl-localematcher';\nimport Negotiator from 'negotiator';\nimport { type NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server';\n\nimport { i18n } from './i18n-config';\n\nfunction getLocale(request: NextRequest) {\n  const headers = {\n    'accept-language': request.headers.get('accept-language') ?? '',\n  };\n  const languages = new Negotiator({ headers }).languages();\n  return match(languages, i18n.locales, i18n.defaultLocale);\n}\n\nexport function localizationMiddleware(request: NextRequest) {\n  const { pathname } = request.nextUrl;\n  const pathnameHasLocale = i18n.locales.some(\n    locale => pathname.startsWith(`/${locale}/`) || pathname === `/${locale}`,\n  );\n\n  if (pathnameHasLocale) {\n    return;\n  }","if (pathnameHasLocale) {\n    return;\n  }\n\n  const locale = getLocale(request);\n  request.nextUrl.pathname = `/${locale}${pathname}`;\n  return NextResponse.redirect(request.nextUrl);\n}\nThe purpose of this middleware is to automatically detect and redirect your users to the appropriate language version of the website based on their browser language preferences.Then create a middleware file src/middleware.ts in the root of your project, and use your localization middleware there.import { NextRequest } from 'next/server';\n\nimport { localizationMiddleware } from './features/internationalization/localization-middleware';\n\n// Matcher ignoring `/_next/` and `/api/` and svg files.\nexport const config = { matcher: ['/((?!api|_next|.*.svg$).*)'] };","export function middleware(request: NextRequest) {\n  return localizationMiddleware(request);\n}\nIt's time to add your translations. Create a json dictionary for your English translations at src/features/internationalization/dictionaries/en-us.json.{\n  \"counter\": {\n    \"decrement\": \"Decrement\",\n    \"increment\": \"Increment\"\n  },\n  \"landing\": {\n    \"welcome\": \"Welcome\"\n  }\n}\nAnd then, create a file src/features/internationalization/get-dictionaries.ts for your getDictionary function.import \"server-only\";\nimport type { Locale } from \"./i18n-config\";\n\n// We enumerate all dictionaries here for better linting and typescript support.\n// We also get the default import for cleaner types.\nconst dictionaries = {\n  \"en-US\": () => import(\"./dictionaries/en-US.json\").then((module) => module.default),\n};","export const getDictionary = async (locale: Locale) =>\n  dictionaries[locale]?.() ?? dictionaries[\"en-US\"]();\nIt takes in a locale and then returns the respective dictionary.If you want to add a hook that lets your users pick their language, it can look like this.import { usePathname } from 'next/navigation';\n\nimport { Locale } from './i18n-config';\n\nexport function useSwitchLocaleHref() {\n  const pathName = usePathname();\n\n  const getSwitchLocaleHref = (locale: Locale) => {\n    if (!pathName) return '/';\n    const segments = pathName.split('/');\n    segments[1] = locale;\n    return segments.join('/');\n  };","return getSwitchLocaleHref;\n}\nAnd then you can use that hook in a component, and use it's return value in a <Link /> like this.<Link href={getSwitchLocaleHref(locale)}>{locale}</Link>\nChange your URL structure to support i18n. Create a new folder [lang] in your app/ folder, which creates a dynamic segment for the language.Move your page.tsx and layout.tsx files into that folder, and modify the layout to set the correct language on the <html /> tag.import '../globals.css';\n\nimport type { Metadata } from 'next';\nimport { Inter } from 'next/font/google';\n\nimport { Locale } from '@/features/internationalization/i18n-config';\n\nconst inter = Inter({ subsets: ['latin'] });\n\nexport const metadata: Metadata = {\n  title: \"Jan Hesters' Next.js for production tutorial\",\n  description: 'Brought to you by ReactSquad.io',\n};","export default function RootLayout({\n  children,\n  params,\n}: Readonly<{\n  children: React.ReactNode;\n  params: { lang: Locale };\n}>) {\n  return (\n    <html lang={params.lang}>\n      <body className={inter.className}>{children}</body>\n    </html>\n  );\n}\nGoing forward, you can use the getDictionary function in any server component.import { getDictionary } from '@/features/internationalization/get-dictionaries';\nimport { Locale } from '@/features/internationalization/i18n-config';\n\nimport { CounterComponent } from './counter-component';\n\nexport default async function IndexPage({\n  params: { lang },\n}: {\n  params: { lang: Locale };\n}) {\n  const dictionary = await getDictionary(lang);\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <p>Current locale: {lang}</p>\n      <p>This text is rendered on the server: {dictionary.landing.welcome}</p>\n      <CounterComponent dictionary={dictionary.counter} />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\nFor client components, you'll want to pass in the respective dictionary instead.'use client';","import { useState } from 'react';\n\nimport type { getDictionary } from '@/features/internationalization/get-dictionaries';\n\nexport function CounterComponent({\n  dictionary,\n}: {\n  dictionary: Awaited<ReturnType<typeof getDictionary>>['counter'];\n}) {\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);","return (\n    <p>\n      This component is rendered on the client:\n      <button onClick={() => setCount(n => n - 1)}>\n        {dictionary.decrement}\n      </button>\n      {count}\n      <button onClick={() => setCount(n => n + 1)}>\n        {dictionary.increment}\n      </button>\n    </p>\n  );\n}\nDatabaseThis tutorial is going to use Postgres for its database because it is well battle-tested, but you're going to use the Prisma ORM to abstract away the database layer. This gives you the flexibility to use a variety of databases, and simplifies the API that you use to interact with it.npm install prisma --save-dev\nYou'll also need to install the Prisma client.npm install @prisma/client\nInitialize Prisma.npx prisma init\nThis auto-generates your prisma/schema.prisma file.generator client {\n  provider = \"prisma-client-js\"\n}\n\ndatasource db {\n  provider = \"postgresql\"\n  // Uses connection pooling\n  url = env(\"DATABASE_URL\")\n}","model UserProfile {\n  id                         String   @id @default(cuid())\n  createdAt                  DateTime @default(now())\n  updatedAt                  DateTime @updatedAt\n  email                      String   @unique\n  name                       String   @default(\"\")\n  acceptedTermsAndConditions Boolean  @default(false)\n}\nAdd a aUserProfile model to it, which has an email and a name and a boolean whether they accepted your terms and conditions.If you ran npx prisma init, rename your .env file to .env.local, otherwise create it and make sure it contains the credentials for your Prisma database.DATABASE_URL=\"postgresql://johndoe:randompassword@localhost:5432/mydb?schema=public\"\nNow create a src/lib/prisma.ts file, which will contain your Prisma client connection.import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client';\n\ndeclare global {\n  var __database__: PrismaClient;\n}\n\nlet prisma: PrismaClient;","declare global {\n  var __database__: PrismaClient;\n}\n\nlet prisma: PrismaClient;\n\nif (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production') {\n  prisma = new PrismaClient();\n} else {\n  if (!global.__database__) {\n    global.__database__ = new PrismaClient();\n  }\n  prisma = global.__database__;\n}","export default prisma;\nThe re-assignment ensures that in a non-production environment (like during development or testing), only one instance of the Prisma client is created and reused across the entire application. This approach prevents the overhead of repeatedly initializing new connections to the database every time a module that needs database access is imported.Modify your package.json to include the following helper commands for Prisma.\"prisma:deploy\": \"npx prisma migrate deploy && npx prisma generate\",\n\"prisma:migrate\": \"npx prisma migrate dev --name\",\n\"prisma:push\": \"npx prisma db push && npx prisma generate\",\n\"prisma:reset-dev\": \"run-s prisma:wipe prisma:seed dev\",\n\"prisma:seed\": \"tsx ./prisma/seed.ts\",\n\"prisma:setup\": \"prisma generate && prisma migrate deploy && prisma db push\",\n\"prisma:studio\": \"npx prisma studio\",\n\"prisma:wipe\": \"npx prisma migrate reset --force && npx prisma db push\",","\"prisma:wipe\": \"npx prisma migrate reset --force && npx prisma db push\",\nSome of these commands use the run-s, tsx and dotenv packages, which you'll need to install.npm install --save-dev npm-run-all tsx dotenv","Here‚Äôs an explanation of each Prisma command:\"prisma:deploy\": Deploys database migrations and generates Prisma Client. It runs migrations on production databases and updates the client API.\"prisma:migrate\": Creates a new migration from changes in the Prisma schema, applying it in the development environment. You must specify a name for the migration after the command.\"prisma:push\": Pushes the schema changes directly to the database and updates the Prisma Client. Useful for prototyping without creating migration files.\"prisma:reset-dev\": Resets the development database by wiping it, re-seeding it, and applying migrations in development mode.\"prisma:seed\": Runs a TypeScript seed script to populate the database with initial data.\"prisma:setup\": Generates the Prisma Client, deploys migrations to the database, and pushes the schema to the database.\"prisma:studio\": Opens Prisma Studio, a GUI for viewing and editing the database records.\"prisma:wipe\": Resets the database by forcefully","a GUI for viewing and editing the database records.\"prisma:wipe\": Resets the database by forcefully dropping all data and migrations and then pushes the schema changes.npm run prisma:setup","If your Prisma doesn't recognize your .env.local file, set your environment variable manually in your terminal. On Mac, this can be done using the export command.export DATABASE_URL=\"postgresql://johndoe:randompassword@localhost:5432/mydb?schema=public\"\nCreate a prisma/seed.ts file. You can use it to seed your database with data for development.import { exit } from 'node:process';","import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client';\nimport dotenv from 'dotenv';\n\ndotenv.config({ path: '.env.local' });\n\nconst prisma = new PrismaClient();\n\nconst prettyPrint = (object: any) =>\n  console.log(JSON.stringify(object, undefined, 2));\n\nasync function seed() {\n  const user = await prisma.userProfile.create({\n    data: {\n      email: 'jan@reactsquad.io',\n      name: 'Jan Hesters',\n      acceptedTermsAndConditions: true,\n    },\n  });\n\n  console.log('========= üå± result of seed: =========');\n  prettyPrint({ user });\n}\n\nseed()\n  .then(async () => {\n    await prisma.$disconnect();\n  })\n  // eslint-disable-next-line unicorn/prefer-top-level-await\n  .catch(async error => {\n    console.error(error);\n    await prisma.$disconnect();\n    exit(1);\n  });\nIf you run it, it'll create your user.$ npm run prisma:seed\n\n> reactsquad-production@0.1.0 prisma:seed\n> tsx ./prisma/seed.ts","> reactsquad-production@0.1.0 prisma:seed\n> tsx ./prisma/seed.ts\n\n========= üå± result of seed: =========\n{\n  \"user\": {\n    \"id\": \"clzekb5sp0000ock9gsp72p33\",\n    \"createdAt\": \"2024-08-03T20:04:27.289Z\",\n    \"updatedAt\": \"2024-08-03T20:04:27.289Z\",\n    \"email\": \"jan@reactsquad.io\",\n    \"name\": \"Jan Hesters\",\n    \"acceptedTermsAndConditions\": true\n  }\n}\nIn your server components, you can use prisma to fetch any data.import prisma from '@/lib/prisma';\nimport {\n  Card,\n  CardContent,\n  CardHeader,\n  CardTitle,\n} from '@/components/ui/card';\n\nexport default async function Dashboard() {\n  const user = await prisma.userProfile.findUnique({\n    where: { email: 'jan@reactsquad.io' },\n  });","return (\n    <Card className=\"max-w-md mx-auto\">\n      <CardHeader>\n        <CardTitle>User Profile</Card.Title>\n      </CardHeader>\n      <CardContent>\n        {user ? (\n          <ul>\n            <li>Name: {user.name}</li>\n            <li>Email: {user.email}</li>\n          </ul>\n        ) : (\n          <p>User not found.</p>\n        )}\n      </CardContent>\n    </Card>\n  );\n}\nUse FacadesIt's a good idea to abstract away your database calls using facades. A facade is a design pattern where you provide a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.Create a file that contains all facades related to your user profile model features/user-profile/user-profile-model.ts.import { UserProfile } from '@prisma/client';\n\nimport prisma from '@/lib/prisma';","import prisma from '@/lib/prisma';\n\nexport async function retrieveUserProfileFromDatabaseByEmail(\n  email: UserProfile['email'],\n) {\n  return await prisma.userProfile.findUnique({ where: { email } });\n}\nThere are two main reasons for using facades.Increase vendor resistance - You can switch third-party providers easily. For example, you might switch from Firebase to Supabase or vice versa. Instead of updating your whole codebase to reflect the change, you only update the facade.Simplify your code - A facade can reduce the code you need to write in your application because it reduces the API to your specific application needs. Simultaneously, it makes your code easier to understand because you can give the facade descriptive names.Then use your facade in your server component.import { retrieveUserProfileFromDatabaseByEmail } from '@/features/user-profiles/user-profiles-model';\nimport {\n  Card,\n  CardContent,\n  CardHeader,\n  CardTitle,\n} from '@/components/ui/card';","export default async function Dashboard() {\n  const user =\n    await retrieveUserProfileFromDatabaseByEmail('jan@reactsquad.io');\n\n  return (\n    <Card className=\"max-w-md mx-auto\">\n      <CardHeader>\n        <CardTitle>User Profile</Card.Title>\n      </CardHeader>","<CardContent>\n        {user ? (\n          <ul>\n            <li>Name: {user.name}</li>\n            <li>Email: {user.email}</li>\n          </ul>\n        ) : (\n          <p>User not found.</p>\n        )}\n      </CardContent>\n    </Card>\n  );\n}",") : (\n          <p>User not found.</p>\n        )}\n      </CardContent>\n    </Card>\n  );\n}\nVercel PostgresYou can use Vercel Postgres for your production deployment. They have an easy to follow guide, which you can check out in the Vercel documentation. But here are the steps real quick for your convenience.To set up a database in your Vercel project, follow these steps:Go to the Storage tab and click the Create Database button.When the Browse Storage modal opens, choose Postgres and click Continue.For creating a new database:In the dialog box, type sample_postgres_db (or a name you prefer) in the Store Name field. Ensure the name has only alphanumeric characters, \"_\" or \"-\", and does not exceed 32 characters.Choose a region. For lower latency, select a region close to your function region, which is US East by default.Click Create.Then you'll need to add POSTGRES_URL_NON_POOLING to the datasource in your Prisma schema.datasource db {\n  provider  = \"postgresql\"","provider  = \"postgresql\"\n  // Uses connection pooling\n  url       = env(\"DATABASE_URL\")\n  // Uses direct connection, ‚ö†Ô∏è make sure to keep this to `POSTGRES_URL_NON_POOLING`\n  // or you'll have dangling databases from migrations\n  directUrl = env(\"POSTGRES_URL_NON_POOLING\")\n}\nVercel uses connection poolers, which manage a pool of database connections that can be reused by different parts of an application, rather than establishing a new connection for each database request. The directUrl property is used to ensure operations requiring direct database access, such as migrations, can bypass the connection pooler for reliable execution.You can get the environment variables for your Vercel database by pulling them from Vercel.vercel env pull .env","PlaywrightYou also want to use E2E tests because E2E tests give you the most confidence that your app works as intended. E2E tests are skipped far too often, but you really should make it a habit to write them. The benefits are compounding.Initialize Playwright.$ npm init playwright@latest\nGetting started with writing end-to-end tests with Playwright:\nInitializing project in '.'\n‚úî Where to put your end-to-end tests? ¬∑ playwright\n‚úî Add a GitHub Actions workflow? (y/N) ¬∑ false\n‚úî Install Playwright browsers (can be done manually via 'npx playwright install')? (Y/n) ¬∑ true\nIf this is your first time using Playwright, you can have a look through the test-examples/ folder that the initialization script creates, and then deleted it because you won't need it.Modify the webServer key in your playwright.config.ts file.webServer: {\n  command: process.env.CI ? 'npm run build && npm run start' : 'npm run dev',\n  port: 3000,\n},","command: process.env.CI ?

requirements","Before you begin, make sure your system meets the following requirements:\n\nNode.js 18.18 or later.\nmacOS, Windows (including WSL), or Linux.\n\nAutomatic installation","Node.js 18.18 or later.\nmacOS, Windows (including WSL), or Linux.\n\nAutomatic installation\n\n\n\n\n\nThe quickest way to create a new Next.js app is using create-next-app, which sets up everything automatically for you. To create a project, run:\nTerminalnpx create-next-app@latest\nOn installation, you'll see the following prompts:\nTerminalWhat is your project named? my-app\nWould you like to use TypeScript? No / Yes\nWould you like to use ESLint? No / Yes\nWould you like to use Tailwind CSS? No / Yes\nWould you like your code inside a `src/` directory? No / Yes\nWould you like to use App Router? (recommended) No / Yes\nWould you like to use Turbopack for `next dev`?  No / Yes\nWould you like to customize the import alias (`@/*` by default)? No / Yes\nWhat import alias would you like configured? @/*\nAfter the prompts, create-next-app will create a folder with your project name and install the required dependencies.\nManual installation","To manually create a new Next.js app, install the required packages:\nTerminalnpm install next@latest react@latest react-dom@latest\nThen, add the following scripts to your package.json file:\npackage.json{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"dev\": \"next dev\",\n    \"build\": \"next build\",\n    \"start\": \"next start\",\n    \"lint\": \"next lint\"\n  }\n}\nThese scripts refer to the different stages of developing an application:\n\nnext dev: Starts the development server.\nnext build: Builds the application for production.\nnext start: Starts the production server.\nnext lint: Runs ESLint.\n\nCreate the app directory","Create the app directory\n\n\n\n\nNext.js uses file-system routing, which means the routes in your application are determined by how you structure your files.Create an app folder. Then, inside app, create a layout.tsx file. This file is the root layout. It's required and must contain the <html> and <body> tags.app/layout.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptexport default function RootLayout({\n  children,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n}) {\n  return (\n    <html lang=\"en\">\n      <body>{children}</body>\n    </html>\n  )\n}Create a home page app/page.tsx with some initial content:app/page.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptexport default function Page() {\n  return <h1>Hello, Next.js!</h1>\n}Both layout.tsx and page.tsx will be rendered when the user visits the root of your application (/).\nGood to know:","If you forget to create the root layout, Next.js will automatically create this file when running the development server with next dev.\nYou can optionally use a src folder in the root of your project to separate your application's code from configuration files.\n\n\n\nCreate the public folder (optional)\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a public folder at the root of your project to store static assets such as images, fonts, etc. Files inside public can then be referenced by your code starting from the base URL (/).\nYou can then reference these assets using the root path (/). For example, public/profile.png can be referenced as /profile.png:\napp/page.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptimport Image from 'next/image'\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  return <Image src=\"/profile.png\" alt=\"Profile\" width={100} height={100} />\n}\n\nRun the development server","Run the development server\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRun npm run dev to start the development server.\nVisit http://localhost:3000 to view your application.\nEdit theapp/page.tsx  file and save it to see the updated result in your browser.\n\nSet up TypeScript\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMinimum TypeScript version: v4.5.2\n\nNext.js comes with built-in TypeScript support. To add TypeScript to your project, rename a file to .ts / .tsx and run next dev. Next.js will automatically install the necessary dependencies and add a tsconfig.json file with the recommended config options.\nIDE Plugin\n\n\n\n\nNext.js includes a custom TypeScript plugin and type checker, which VSCode and other code editors can use for advanced type-checking and auto-completion.You can enable the plugin in VS Code by:\nOpening the command palette (Ctrl/‚åò + Shift + P)\nSearching for \"TypeScript: Select TypeScript Version\"\nSelecting \"Use Workspace Version\"\n\nSee the TypeScript reference page for more information.\nSet up ESLint","See the TypeScript reference page for more information.\nSet up ESLint\n\n\n\n\n\nNext.js comes with built-in ESLint. It automatically installs the necessary packages and configures the proper settings when you create a new project with create-next-app.\nTo manually add ESLint to an existing project, add next lint as a script to package.json:\npackage.json{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"lint\": \"next lint\"\n  }\n}\nThen, run npm run lint and you will be guided through the installation and configuration process.\nTerminalnpm run lint\nYou'll see a prompt like this:\n\n? How would you like to configure ESLint?\n‚ùØ Strict (recommended)\nBase\nCancel\n\n\nStrict: Includes Next.js' base ESLint configuration along with a stricter Core Web Vitals rule-set. This is the recommended configuration for developers setting up ESLint for the first time.\nBase: Includes Next.js' base ESLint configuration.\nCancel: Skip configuration. Select this option if you plan on setting up your own custom ESLint configuration.","If Strict or Base are selected, Next.js will automatically install eslint and eslint-config-next as dependencies in your application and create an .eslintrc.json file in the root of your project that includes your selected configuration.\nYou can now run next lint every time you want to run ESLint to catch errors. Once ESLint has been set up, it will also automatically run during every build (next build). Errors will fail the build, while warnings will not.\nSee the ESLint Plugin page for more information.\nSet up Absolute Imports and Module Path Aliases","Next.js has in-built support for the \"paths\" and \"baseUrl\" options of tsconfig.json and jsconfig.json files.\nThese options allow you to alias project directories to absolute paths, making it easier and cleaner to import modules. For example:\n// Before\nimport { Button } from '../../../components/button'\n \n// After\nimport { Button } from '@/components/button'\nTo configure absolute imports, add the baseUrl configuration option to your tsconfig.json or jsconfig.json file. For example:\ntsconfig.json or jsconfig.json{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"baseUrl\": \"src/\"\n  }\n}\nIn addition to configuring the baseUrl path, you can use the \"paths\" option to \"alias\" module paths.\nFor example, the following configuration maps @/components/* to components/*:\ntsconfig.json or jsconfig.json{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"baseUrl\": \"src/\",\n    \"paths\": {\n      \"@/styles/*\": [\"styles/*\"],\n      \"@/components/*\": [\"components/*\"]\n    }\n  }\n}","\"@/styles/*\": [\"styles/*\"],\n      \"@/components/*\": [\"components/*\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\nEach of the \"paths\" are relative to the baseUrl location.PreviousGetting StartedNextProject StructureWas this helpful?","supported.Send\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResourcesDocsSupport

One way we can achieve this gem is by using quality web-building tools like NextJS- to enhance web performance such as lazy-image loading, Typescript- to keep code quality and avoid future spills and ChakraUI- to build accessibly user-friend interfaces. \nThis article will be working us through how we can combine these ‚Äúpowers‚Äù to build a ‚Äúsuperpowered‚Äù web application\nStep One- Initiate NextJS with Typescript: (Docs)\nIn our terminal, navigate to a directory to create a new project. Using your preferred package manager, let‚Äôs create a React project powered with NextJS and Typescript using this command: \nyarn create next-app --typescript or npx create-next-app@latest --ts. \nIn the process of running this command, the terminal will pop up a dialog asking us to name our new project. Let‚Äôs call it doggies (A Dog-interest website) and we are golden!","PS: The --ts or --typescript is a flag to tell the package manager to initiate a React project with Typescript.","Step Two- Install ChakraUI: (Docs)\nAfter successfully creating our project that is powered with NextJS and Typescript, let‚Äôs now install ChakraUI. Before running the command to install ChakraUI, navigate to the root of the project, then go ahead to install ChakraUI using this command: \nyarn add @chakra-ui/react @emotion/react@^11 @emotion/styled@^11 framer-motion@^6\nor\nnpm i @chakra-ui/react @emotion/react@^11 @emotion/styled@^11 framer-motion@^6 \nAnd that‚Äôs it! ChakraUI is now available on our project. To have full access to the goodies that comes with ChakraUI we need to do one last thing and that takes us to step number 3.\n\n\nStep Three- Activate the power of ChakraUI.\nTo do this, we need to access the _app.tsx file inside our Pages folder of our project and wrap its return components in a ChakraProvider Component. \nThis is what the file looks like by default:\n\n\nimport type { AppProps } from 'next/app'","import type { AppProps } from 'next/app'\n\nfunction MyApp({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) {\n  return <Component {...pageProps} />\n}\n\nexport default MyApp\n\n\n\nEnter fullscreen mode\n\n\nExit fullscreen mode\n\n\n\n\n\nSo now let‚Äôs import ChakraProvider and use it as a wrapper before returning the Components. Our file should now look like this:\n\n\nimport '../styles/globals.css'\nimport type { AppProps } from 'next/app'\nimport { ChakraProvider } from '@chakra-ui/react'\n\nfunction MyApp({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) {\n  return (\n    <ChakraProvider>\n      <Component {...pageProps} />\n    </ChakraProvider>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default MyApp;\n\n\n\nEnter fullscreen mode\n\n\nExit fullscreen mode","export default MyApp;\n\n\n\nEnter fullscreen mode\n\n\nExit fullscreen mode\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd there it is! Our application is now powered with NextJS, Typescript and ChakraUI. \nTo see the smooth user interfaces your can create with ChakraUI you can check the documentation of all its components here. \nI‚Äôll be writing an article about why this setup is my favourite and what opportunities this gives us, until then, have a good day and stay well!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Top comments (1)\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonal\nTrusted User\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Create template\n      \nTemplates let you quickly answer FAQs or store snippets for re-use.\n\n\n\nSubmit\nPreview\nDismiss\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCollapse\n\n\nExpand\n\n\n\n\n\n\n¬†\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInfo\n\n\n\n      Comment hidden by post author - thread only accessible via permalink\n  \n\n\nDustinSeals\n\n\n\n      DustinSeals\n      \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      DustinSeals\n      \n    \n\n\n\nFollow","DustinSeals\n\n\n\n      DustinSeals\n      \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      DustinSeals\n      \n    \n\n\n\nFollow\n\n\n    I am Dustin .

For example if the user sets their computer to dark mode by default, Chakra-UI will default to dark mode.\nComposibility: Components can be created from the Chakra-UI ones or if needed custom components can be created with ease.\nTypescript Support: Chakra-UI is written in TypeScript and provides class types for easy integration.\n\n\n\n\n\n  What we will be making\n\nIn this tutorial we will use Chakra-UI to create a simple user list/profile page. \nWe will also integrate a toggler to toggle between light and dark mode.\nYou will learn how to set up a basic Next.js application with Chakra-UI integration.\n\n\n\n\n  Creating the Next.js application and installing the dependencies","Creating the Next.js application and installing the dependencies\n\nFirst we need to create a new Next.js app and install the dependencies needed for the example.\nThe Next.js app can be created via the following command:\n\n\n\nnpx create-next-app@latest\n\n\n\n\n\nEnter fullscreen mode\n\n\nExit fullscreen mode\n\n\n\n\n\nThis will set up the Next.js project automatically for you.\nNext we need to install Chakra-ui which can be done via the following command:\n\n\n\nyarn add @chakra-ui/react @emotion/react@^11 @emotion/styled@^11 framer-motion@^4 @chakra-ui/icons\n\n\n\n\n\nEnter fullscreen mode\n\n\nExit fullscreen mode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Creating fake Users\n\nNext we will need some fake users to actually populate the page. \nCreate a \"data\" folder in the root directory and create a \"users.js\" file and populate it with the following data: (feel free to use your own custom data but be careful of the parameter names):\nhttps://github.com/ethand91/nextjs-chakra-sample/blob/main/data/users.js\n\n\n\n\n  Creating the components","Creating the components\n\nNext we need to create the components needed for the sample page, create a new folder called \"components\" and within that create a \"TopBar\" folder.\nWithin the TopBar folder create a new file called \"index.js\" and populate it with the following contents:\n\n\n\nimport {\n  Box,\n  Button,\n  useColorMode\n} from '@chakra-ui/react';\nimport { MoonIcon, SunIcon } from '@chakra-ui/icons';\n\nfunction TopBar() {\n  const { colorMode, toggleColorMode } = useColorMode();\n  const ColorModeIcon = colorMode === 'light' ? SunIcon : MoonIcon;\n\n  return (\n    <Box width=\"100%\" padding=\"1\" backgroundColor=\"purple.700\">\n      <Box maxWidth=\"container.xl\" margin=\"auto\">\n        <Button\n          aria-label=\"ui theme\"\n          leftIcon={ <ColorModeIcon /> }\n          onClick={ toggleColorMode }\n          size=\"xs\"\n          marginRight=\"2\"\n          borderRadius=\"sm\"\n        >\n          Toggle Theme\n        </Button>\n      </Box>\n    </Box>\n  );  \n};\n\nexport default TopBar;","export default TopBar;\n\n\n\n\n\nEnter fullscreen mode\n\n\nExit fullscreen mode\n\n\n\n\n\nHere we create a simple top bar for the application, we give it a background color of purple and also provide a button that allows the user to toggle between light/dark mode using Chakra-UI.\nNext we need a component to display the users, so create a new \"UserCard\" directory and within that directory create an \"index.js\" file and populate it with the following contents:\n\n\n\nimport Link from 'next/link';\nimport {\n  Box,\n  Text,\n  Avatar,\n  Center,\n  VStack,\n  useColorModeValue\n} from '@chakra-ui/react';","function UserCard(props) {\n  return (\n    <Link href={ `/users/${props.username}` } passHref>\n      <VStack\n        spacing=\"4\"\n        borderRadius=\"md\"\n        boxShadow=\"x1\"\n        padding=\"5\"\n        backgroundColor={\n          useColorModeValue('gray.50', 'gray.700')\n        }\n      >   \n        <Center>\n          <Avatar size=\"lg\" src={ props.avatar } />\n        </Center>\n        <Center>\n          <Box textAlign=\"center\">\n            <Text fontWeight=\"bold\" fontSize=\"xl\">\n              { props.first_name } { props.last_name }\n            </Text>\n            <Text fontSize=\"xs\">{ props.job_title }</Text>\n          </Box>\n        </Center>\n      </VStack>\n    </Link>\n  );  \n};\n\nexport default UserCard;\n\n\n\n\n\nEnter fullscreen mode\n\n\nExit fullscreen mode\n\n\n\n\n\nThis card will link to the user details page, using Chakra-UI we are easily able to center contents using \"Center\". We also use Avatar to easily display the user's profile picture.\nThats the components created.","Creating the Pages\n\nNext we need to start working on the pages.\nWe will be overriding the default Next.js document which can be done by creating a \"_document.js\" inside the pages directory. \nCreate the file and populate it with the following:\n\n\n\nimport { ColorModeScript } from '@chakra-ui/react';\nimport NextDocument, {\n  Html,\n  Head,\n  Main,\n  NextScript\n} from 'next/document';\nimport { extendTheme } from '@chakra-ui/react';\n\nconst config = { \n  useSystemColorMode: true\n};\n\nconst theme = extendTheme({ config }); \n\nexport default class Document extends NextDocument {\n  render () {\n    return (\n      <Html lang=\"en\">\n        <Head />\n        <body>\n          <ColorModeScript\n            initialColorMode={ theme.config.initialColorMode }\n          />\n          <Main />\n          <NextScript />\n        </body>\n      </Html>\n    );  \n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nEnter fullscreen mode\n\n\nExit fullscreen mode","Enter fullscreen mode\n\n\nExit fullscreen mode\n\n\n\n\n\nThe reason for overriding the default layout is because we want to apply both light/dark theme to the entire page.\nNext we need to apply Chara-UI to the application so open up pages/_app.js and change the contents to the following:\n\n\n\nimport { ChakraProvider, Box } from '@chakra-ui/react';\nimport TopBar from './../components/TopBar';\n\nfunction MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {\n  return (\n    <ChakraProvider>\n      <TopBar />\n      <Box maxWidth=\"container.xl\" margin=\"auto\">\n        <Component { ...pageProps} />\n      </Box>\n    </ChakraProvider>\n  );  \n}\n\nexport default MyApp\n\n\n\n\n\nEnter fullscreen mode\n\n\nExit fullscreen mode\n\n\n\n\n\nHere we bascially tell Next.js to use the Chara-UI provider and make sure everypage has our custom TopBar.\nNext we need to edit the pages/index.js to contain the following contents:\n\n\n\nimport {\n  Box,\n  Grid,\n  Text,\n  GridItem\n} from '@chakra-ui/react';","import {\n  Box,\n  Grid,\n  Text,\n  GridItem\n} from '@chakra-ui/react';\n\nimport UserCard from './../components/UserCard';\nimport users from './../data/users';\n\nexport default function Home() {\n  return (\n    <Box>\n      <Text\n        fontSize=\"xxx-large\"\n        fontWeight=\"extrabold\"\n        textAlign=\"center\"\n        marginTop=\"9\"\n      >   \n        Users\n      </Text>\n\n      <Grid\n        gridTemplateColumns={ ['1fr', 'repeat(2, 1fr)', 'repeat(3, 1fr)'] }\n        gridGap=\"10\"\n        padding=\"10\"\n      >   \n        {\n          users.map((user) => (\n            <GridItem key={ user.id }>\n              <UserCard { ...user } />\n            </GridItem>\n          ))\n        }\n      </Grid>\n    </Box>\n  );  \n}\n\n\n\n\n\nEnter fullscreen mode\n\n\nExit fullscreen mode","Enter fullscreen mode\n\n\nExit fullscreen mode\n\n\n\n\n\nHere we basically list all the users using Chakra-UI's Grid component. The \"gridTemplateColumns\" allows us to set the sizes for small screens, medium screens and large screens. For example if you view the page on a large screen each row will have 3 users, however if you view it on a mobile device each row will only have one user.\nFeel free to run the project using:\n\n\n\nnpm run dev\n\n\n\n\n\nEnter fullscreen mode\n\n\nExit fullscreen mode\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you access the page (https://localhost:3000), you should see the following page:\n\nIf you prefer light mode you should see the following:","If you prefer light mode you should see the following:\n\nFeel free to play with the toggle button. If you try clicking on a user you will be greeted with a 404 not found response so let's create the user profile page!\nCreate a \"users\" folder inside the pages folder and create the \"[username].js\". (Note if you're using a terminal like me you may need to escape the brackets with a backslash).\nNow fill the file with the following contents:\n\n\n\nmport Link from 'next/link';\nimport {\n  Avatar,\n  Box,\n  Center,\n  Text,\n  Image,\n  Button,\n  Flex,\n  useColorModeValue\n} from '@chakra-ui/react';\n\nimport users from './../../data/users';\n\nexport function getStaticPaths() {\n  const paths = users.map((user) => ({\n    params: {\n      username: user.username\n    }   \n  }));\n\n  return {\n    paths,\n    fallback: false\n  };  \n}\n\nexport function getStaticProps({ params }) {\n  const { username } = params;","export function getStaticProps({ params }) {\n  const { username } = params;\n\n  return { \n    props: {\n      user: users.find((user) => user.username === username)\n    }   \n  };  \n};\n\nfunction UserPage({ user }) {\n  return (\n    <Center\n      marginTop={ ['0', '0', '8' ] }\n      boxShadow=\"lg\"\n      minHeight=\"fit-content\"\n    >\n      <Box>\n        <Box position=\"relative\">\n          <Image src={user.cover_image} width=\"fit-content\" height=\"250px\" objectFit=\"cover\" />\n\n          <Flex\n            alignItems=\"flex-end\"\n            position=\"absolute\"\n            top=\"0\"\n            left=\"0\"\n            backgroundColor={\n              useColorModeValue('blackAlpha.400', 'blackAlpha.600')\n            }\n            width=\"100%\"\n            height=\"100%\"\n            padding=\"8\"\n            color=\"white\"","<Avatar size=\"lg\" src={ user.avatar } />\n            <Box marginLeft=\"6\">\n              <Text as=\"h1\" fontSize=\"xx-large\" fontWeight=\"bold\">\n                { user.first_name } { user.last_name }\n              </Text>\n              <Text as=\"p\" fontSize=\"large\" lineHeight=\"1.5\">\n                { user.job_title }\n              </Text>\n            </Box>\n          </Flex>\n        </Box>\n        <Box\n          maxW=\"container.xl\"\n          margin=\"auto\"\n          padding=\"8\"\n          backgroundColor={\n            useColorModeValue('white', 'gray.700')\n          }\n        >\n          <Text as=\"p\">{ user.description }</Text>\n          <Link href=\"/\" passHref>\n            <Button marginTop=\"8\" colorScheme=\"whatsapp\" as=\"a\">\n              Back to all users\n            </Button>\n          </Link>\n        </Box>\n      </Box>\n    </Center>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default UserPage;\n\n\n\n\n\nEnter fullscreen mode\n\n\nExit fullscreen mode","export default UserPage;\n\n\n\n\n\nEnter fullscreen mode\n\n\nExit fullscreen mode\n\n\n\n\n\nPhew! Here we use \"getStaticPaths\" to tell Next.js we need to render a new page for each user in the user's array.\nWe also tell Next.js to display the default 404 page if the requested user is not found.\nChakra-UI allows us to easily center the contents. This page basically displays the contents of the user and provides a button to go back using a Chakra-UI feature.\nAll done fire up the dev server and load up https://localhost:3000 in the browser. \nOnce loading try clicking on a user you should see the following page:\n\n\nAll done! üòé\n\n\n\n\n  Conclusion\n\nHere I have demonstrated how to use Next.js with Chakra-UI.

Parameters roughly correspond to a model‚Äôs problem-solving skills, and models with more parameters generally perform better than those with fewer parameters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe rise of China-originated model series like Qwen have increased the pressure on American labs such as OpenAI to deliver more capable AI technologies. They‚Äôve also led policymakers to implement restrictions aimed at limiting the ability of Chinese AI companies to obtain the chips necessary to train models.","The Qwen3 models support 119 languages, Alibaba says, and were trained on a dataset of nearly 36 trillion tokens. Tokens are the raw bits of data that a model processes; 1 million tokens is equivalent to about 750,000 words. Alibaba says that Qwen3 was trained on a combination of textbooks, ‚Äúquestion-answer pairs,‚Äù code snippets, AI-generated data, and more.\nThese improvements, along with others, greatly boosted Qwen3‚Äôs capabilities compared to its predecessor, Qwen2, says Alibaba. None of the Qwen3 models are head and shoulders above top-of-the-line recent models like OpenAI‚Äôs o3 and o4-mini, but they‚Äôre strong performers nonetheless.\nOn Codeforces, a platform for programming contests, the largest Qwen3 model ‚Äî Qwen-3-235B-A22B ‚Äî just beats out OpenAI‚Äôs o3-mini and Google‚Äôs Gemini 2.5 Pro.

Let me check the context provided.\n> \n> Looking at the sources, there are several mentions of integrating MCP servers with Python and Qwen3. For example, source [1] has code samples that replace Claude Desktop with a Python script and use OpenAI API. Another part [1] shows code using the pydantic_ai library to set up an agent with MCP servers, including time and fetch servers. There's also a section [1] that demonstrates using Qwen3 with MCP servers through the qwen_agent library, specifying model configurations and tools.\n> \n> The user might need a script that initializes an agent with Qwen3 as the LLM backend and connects to MCP servers. The code should include setting up the model with the correct server URL and API key, defining MCP servers, and creating the agent. Also, handling the MCP servers with commands like uvx or npx as seen in the examples.\n> \n> I should structure the script using the pydantic_ai library, set up the OpenAI model with the Qwen3 configuration, define the MCP servers, and then create the agent. Make sure to include the necessary imports and dependencies as mentioned in the sources, like pydantic-ai-slim with MCP support. Also, ensure that the environment variables are set correctly for any API keys or paths.\n> \n> Need to check if there's a specific example in the sources. In source [1], there's code that uses MCPServerStdio with commands like 'uvx' and arguments for time and fetch servers. Also, the example uses the qwen.py script which sets up the agent with specific MCP servers.\n> \n> So, putting it all together: import necessary modules, configure the LLM model with the right parameters, define the MCP servers using MCPServerStdio, and then create the Agent instance. The script should allow the user to run queries through the agent that interacts with MCP servers.\n</details>\nHere's a Python script to access MCP servers using **Qwen3** as the LLM backend. This example uses `pydantic-ai` and integrates with MCP servers like `mcp-server-time` and `mcp-server-fetch`, as shown in the context [1]:\n\n```python\nimport os\nfrom pydantic_ai import Agent\nfrom pydantic_ai.models.openai import OpenAIModel\nfrom pydantic_ai.providers.openai import OpenAIProvider\nfrom pydantic_ai.mcp import MCPServerStdio\n\n# --- 1. Configure the LLM backend (Qwen3) ---\nllm = OpenAIModel(\n    model_name=\"qwen3:30b\",  # Use the correct model tag\n    provider=OpenAIProvider(\n        base_url=\"http://localhost:11434/v1\",  # Ollama or proxy URL\n    ),\n)\n\n# --- 2. Define MCP servers to use ---\nmcp_servers = [\n    MCPServerStdio(\n        command=\"uvx\",  # Use the correct executable (e.g., `npx` or `uvx`)\n        args=[\"mcp-server-time\", \"--local-timezone=Asia/Shanghai\"]\n    ),\n    MCPServerStdio(\n        command=\"uvx\",\n        args=[\"mcp-server-fetch\"]\n    ),\n]\n\n# --- 3. Create the Agent ---\nagent = Agent(\n    model=llm,\n    mcp_servers=mcp_servers,\n    system_message=\"You are a helpful assistant. Use MCP tools for accurate answers.\"\n)\n\n# --- 4. Define a function to run queries ---\ndef ask(query: str):\n    async def run():\n        async with agent.run_mcp_servers():\n            result = await agent.run(query)\n            print(result.output)\n\n    anyio.run(run)\n\n# Example usage\nask(\"What time is it in Shanghai and what's the weather there?\")\n```\n\n---\n\n### Key Notes:\n1. **LLM Backend**: The script assumes Qwen3 is served via Ollama (`http://localhost:11424/v1`) or a proxy. Adjust the `base_url` and `model_name` as needed.\n2. **MCP Servers**: The example uses `mcp-server-time` and `mcp-server-fetch`. Replace these with other servers (e.g., `@modelcontextprotocol/server-brave-search`) as needed [1].\n3. **Dependencies**: Install required packages:\n   ```bash\n   pip install pydantic-ai-slim[mcp,streaming] mcp anyio\n   ```\n4. **Runtime**: Ensure `uvx` or `npx` is available in your environment to launch MCP servers [1].\n\nFor advanced use, you can extend this with tools like `code_interpreter` or integrate with Claude Desktop [1].

Here's a breakdown of the key points discussed:  \n\n---\n\n### **1. Qwen3 Overview**  \n- **Developer**: Alibaba Cloud's Qwen team.  \n- **Model Variants**: Includes sizes from 0.6B to 235B parameters (e.g., Qwen3-7B, Qwen3-14B, Qwen3-32B).  \n- **Features**: Optimized for reasoning, multilingual support (119 languages), trained on ~36 trillion tokens.  \n- **Access**: Available via GitHub (`https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen`) and platforms like Hugging Face, ModelScope, or Kaggle.  \n\n---\n\n### **2. MCP Server Integration with Qwen3**  \n- **MCP (Model Context Protocol)**: A framework for LLMs to interact with external tools/servers.  \n- **Use Case**: Querying real-time data (e.g., time zones, weather) via servers like `mcp-server-time` and `mcp-server-fetch`.  \n- **Tools Required**:  \n  - **Python Libraries**: `pydantic-ai`, `mcp`, and `anyio` for asynchronous execution.  \n  - **MCP Servers**: Run via `uvx` or `npx`, e.g., `mcp-server-time` for time queries, `mcp-server-fetch` for web searches.  \n\n---\n\n### **3. Python Script to Access MCP Servers with Qwen3**  \nHere‚Äôs an enhanced, detailed version of the script:  \n\n```python\nimport os\nfrom pydantic_ai import Agent\nfrom pydantic_ai.models.openai import OpenAIModel\nfrom pydantic_ai.providers.openai import OpenAIProvider\nfrom pydantic_ai.mcp import MCPServerStdio\nimport anyio  # For asynchronous execution\n\n# --- Step 1: Configure the LLM Backend (Qwen3) ---\nllm = OpenAIModel(\n    model_name=\"qwen3:30b\",  # Ensure the correct Qwen3 model tag is used\n    provider=OpenAIProvider(\n        base_url=\"http://localhost:11434/v1\",  # Ollama or proxy URL\n    ),\n)\n\n# --- Step 2: Define MCP Servers to Use ---\nmcp_servers = [\n    MCPServerStdio(\n        command=\"uvx\",  # Or use `npx` if installed\n        args=[\"mcp-server-time\", \"--local-timezone=Asia/Shanghai\"]  # Example: Time server\n    ),\n    MCPServerStdio(\n        command=\"uvx\",\n        args=[\"mcp-server-fetch\"]  # Example: Web search server\n    ),\n]\n\n# --- Step 3: Create the Agent (LLM + MCP Servers) ---\nagent = Agent(\n    model=llm,\n    mcp_servers=mcp_servers,\n    system_message=\"You are a helpful assistant. Use MCP tools for accurate answers.\"\n)\n\n# --- Step 4: Define Function to Run Queries ---\ndef ask(query: str):\n    async def run():\n        try:\n            # Start MCP servers in the background\n            async with agent.run_mcp_servers():\n                result = await agent.run(query)\n                print(f\"‚úÖ Result: {result.output}\")\n        except Exception as e:\n            print(f\"‚ùå Error: {e}\")\n\n    # Run the async function\n    anyio.run(run)\n\n# --- Example Usage ---\nask(\"What time is it in Shanghai and what's the weather there?\")\n```\n\n---\n\n### **4. Key Notes for Implementation**  \n#### **A. Dependencies Installation**  \nInstall the required Python packages:  \n```bash\npip install pydantic-ai-slim[mcp,streaming] mcp anyio uvx\n```\n- `pydantic-ai-slim`: Lightweight framework for LLM agents.  \n- `mcp`: Model Context Protocol library for server communication.  \n- `anyio`: Asynchronous I/O support for Python.  \n- `uvx`: Tool to launch MCP servers (install via `npm install -g uvx` if not already present).  \n\n#### **B. MCP Server Setup**  \n- Ensure `mcp-server-time` and `mcp-server-fetch` are installed. Use `uvx` or `npx`:  \n  ```bash\n  uvx install mcp-server-time\n  uvx install mcp-server-fetch\n  ```\n- Alternatively, use `npx`:  \n  ```bash\n  npx mcp-server-time@latest\n  npx mcp-server-fetch@latest\n  ```\n\n#### **C. Qwen3 Backend Setup**  \n- If using Ollama: Ensure `qwen3:30b` is available via `ollama run qwen3`.  \n- If using a proxy: Replace `http://localhost:11434/v1` with your backend URL.  \n\n#### **D. Troubleshooting**  \n- **Error: MCP Server Not Found**: Verify `uvx` or `npx` is installed and servers are correctly configured.  \n- **Error: Model Not Found**: Confirm `qwen3:30b` is available via Ollama or your proxy.  \n- **Asynchronous Execution**: Ensure `anyio` is properly installed and the script runs in an async environment.  \n\n---\n\n### **5. Advanced Use Cases**  \n- **Extend with Code Interpreter**: Add `code_interpreter` for executing Python code.  \n- **Integrate with Claude Desktop**: Use `@modelcontextprotocol/server-brave-search` for web searches.  \n- **Add More Servers**: Replace `mcp-server-time` and `mcp-server-fetch` with other tools (e.g., `@modelcontextprotocol/server-brave-search`, `mcp-server-calc` for math).  \n\n---\n\n### **6. Final Notes**  \nThis script demonstrates how to combine Qwen3 with MCP servers for real-time queries. If you encounter issues, check:  \n1. **Server Installation**: Ensure `uvx` or `npx` is used to install MCP servers.  \n2. **LLM Backend**: Confirm Qwen3 is accessible via the specified URL.  \n3. **Permissions**: Ensure your environment allows launching servers and accessing external tools.  \n\nLet me know if you need help deploying specific servers or troubleshooting errors!","model":"LMS - .qwen3-14b","modelName":"LMS - .qwen3-14b","modelIdx":0,"userContext":null,"timestamp":1745906774,"statusHistory":[{"action":"web_search","description":"Generating search query","done":false},{"action":"web_search","description":"No search query generated","done":true}],"lastSentence":"3.

For the diff patch example, maybe suggest using the code execution tool to generate a diff or apply it if possible within the sandboxed environment.\n> \n> Finally, summarize the steps and mention any prerequisites like installing necessary tools or ensuring models are available.\n</details>\nTo use **tools** and **function calling features** in Open WebUI with the Qwen3 model, follow these steps. This includes executing Python code and applying diff patches to files (with caveats about sandboxing).\n\n---\n\n### **1. Enable Code Execution in Open WebUI**\nOpen WebUI supports code execution via a sandboxed environment (gVisor) for security. To use it with Qwen3:\n\n#### **Step 1: Install the Code Execution Tool**\n- Go to **Workspace ‚Üí Tools** in Open WebUI.\n- Click **+ Add Tool** and input:\n  - **Toolkit Name**: `Run code`\n  - **Description**: \"Run arbitrary code safely in a gVisor sandbox.\"\n  - Replace the code section with `open-webui/tools/run_code.py` (ensure this file exists).\n  - Click **Save**.\n\n#### **Step 2: Enable the Tool for Qwen3**\n- Go to **Workspace ‚Üí Models**.\n- Find your Qwen3 model and click the pencil (‚úèÔ∏è) icon.\n- Under **Tools**, check the box for `Run code`.\n- Click **Save & Update**.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Example: Execute Python Code with Qwen3**\nOnce enabled, you can prompt Qwen3 to execute code:\n\n#### **Prompt Example**:\n> \"Run a Python script that calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to 10.\"\n\n#### **How It Works**:\n- Qwen3 generates the code (e.g., `sum(range(1, 11))`).\n- You click the **Run code** button in Open WebUI (if enabled as a tool).\n- The output appears in the UI.\n\n#### **Code Execution via Tool**:\nYou can also define a custom tool (e.g., `check_system_status`) as shown in the context [1], which is triggered by a system prompt:\n```python\nclass Tools:\n    def check_system_status():\n        print(\"‚úÖ System status: Active\")\n        return \"System status: Active\"\n```\n- This function is registered in Open WebUI and can be invoked by Qwen3 via the tool system.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Example: Apply a Diff Patch to a File**\nApplying diff patches requires direct file system access, which is **sandboxed** in Open WebUI. However, you can use the `Run code` tool to simulate this:\n\n#### **Step 1: Generate a Diff Patch**\nPrompt Qwen3 to generate a diff (e.g., for a file `example.txt`):\n```python\n# Example: Create a diff patch (hypothetical scenario)\nimport difflib\n\noriginal = \"Hello, world!\\n\"\nmodified = \"Hello, Open WebUI!\\n\"\n\ndiff = difflib.unified_diff(original.splitlines(), modified.splitlines())\nprint(\"\\n\".join(diff))\n```\n\n#### **Step 2: Apply the Diff (Limited Scope)**\n- Open WebUI‚Äôs code execution is sandboxed, so **direct file system access** (e.g., `patch` or `git apply`) is restricted.\n- If your use case allows, you can:\n  - Use the `Run code` tool to generate diffs.\n  - Manually apply patches in a local environment outside the sandbox.\n\n#### **Workaround for Sandboxed Environments**:\nIf you must apply patches within Open WebUI, use the `run_code.py` tool to write files to a sandboxed directory (e.g., `/tmp/`). Example:\n```python\nwith open(\"/tmp/example.txt\", \"w\") as f:\n    f.write(\"Hello, Open WebUI!\\n\")\n```\n\n---\n\n### **4. Key Limitations**\n- **Sandboxing**: Open WebUI‚Äôs code execution is restricted to a gVisor sandbox. Direct file system access (e.g., modifying files outside `/tmp/`) is not allowed.\n- **Tool Compatibility**: Ensure the Qwen3 model supports function calling via Open WebUI‚Äôs tool system. If not, use system prompts to trigger code execution.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Summary**\n- Use Open WebUI‚Äôs `Run code` tool to execute Python scripts with Qwen3.\n- For diff patches, generate diffs via code execution and apply them manually or within the sandboxed environment.\n- Ensure tools are enabled for your Qwen3 model and verify compatibility with Open WebUI‚Äôs sandboxed execution.\n\nFor further details, refer to the [Open WebUI documentation](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui) or check the context [1] for tool configuration steps.","model":"LMS - .qwen3-14b","modelName":"LMS - .qwen3-14b","modelIdx":0,"userContext":null,"timestamp":1745907167,"statusHistory":[{"action":"web_search","description":"Generating search query","done":false},{"action":"web_search","description":"Searching \"{{searchQuery}}\"","query":"How to configure function calling in Open WebUI with Qwen3 for Python code execution and diff patch application","done":false},{"action":"web_search","description":"Searching \"{{searchQuery}}\"","query":"Step-by-step guide to create Modelfile tools for running Python code and applying patches in Open WebUI","done":false},{"action":"web_search","description":"Searched {{count}} sites","urls":["https://docs.openwebui.com/features/code-execution/python/","https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui/discussions/11820","https://open-webui.com/code-execution-for-open-webui/","https://github.com/DTC-United/ollama-with-open-webui","https://gcptutorials.com/post/run-hugging-face-models-locally-with-ollama-step-by-step-python-guide","https://www.gpu-mart.com/blog/custom-llm-models-with-ollama-modelfile"],"done":true}],"sources":[{"source":{"collection_name":"web-search-17fb4305227c161170c9b2803d696506dc025a42ea8cc1347977","name":"How to configure function calling in Open WebUI with Qwen3 for Python code execution and diff patch application","type":"web_search","urls":["https://docs.openwebui.com/features/code-execution/python/"]},"document":["üêç Python Code Execution | Open WebUI","Skip to main contentOpen WebUIüè° HomeüöÄ Getting Started‚≠ê Featuresüõ†Ô∏è Tools & Functionsüñ•Ô∏è Workspaceüí¨ Chat Featuresüêç Code Executionüè∫ Artifactsüêç Python Code Executionüåä MermaidJS RenderingüìÑ Document Extractionüìù Evaluationüîé Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)üî∞ Customizable Bannersü™ù Webhook Integrationsüîí SSO: Federated Authentication Supportüõ†Ô∏è Troubleshootingüìù Tutorialsüî® OpenAPI Tool Servers‚ö° Pipelinesüìã FAQüõ£Ô∏è Roadmapü§ù Contributingüåê Sponsorships‚öñÔ∏è Open WebUI Licenseüè¢ Open WebUI for EnterprisesüéØ Our Missionüë• Our Team‚≠ê Featuresüêç Code Executionüêç Python Code ExecutionOn this pageüêç Python Code Execution\nOverview‚Äã\nOpen WebUI allows for the client-side execution of Python code in the browser, utilizing Pyodide to run scripts within a code block in a chat.

However, some aspects are still unclear, and I would like to hear your thoughts.\nüìå Summary:\n\nDoes Open WebUI natively support OpenAI's \"Function Calling\" API feature?\nThese tools seem to allow executing custom Python scripts within Open WebUI's backend, but does this truly align with function calling?\nUsing system prompts to directly trigger OpenAI Function Calling does not seem to work. Is there a way to achieve function calling purely through system prompts?","However, we are uncertain whether this method constitutes true function calling. Does Open WebUI natively support function calling, or are we just emulating similar functionality with tools?\n\nüöÄ Alternative Approach: Function Calling Simulation with a Filter Class\nThe following Filter class analyzes incoming messages and triggers function calls based on certain keywords.\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Filter:\n    def __init__(self):\n        pass\n\n    def check_system_status(self) -> str:\n        print(\"‚úÖ check_system_status() function executed!\")\n        return \"System status: Active\"\n\n    def outlet(self, body: dict, __user__: Optional[dict] = None) -> dict:\n        print(\"üì¢ outlet is running!\")\n\n        messages = body.get(\"messages\", [])\n        user_message = messages[-2].get(\"content\", \"\") if len(messages) > 1 else \"\"","üöÄ Function Calling Simulation in Open WebUI (Using Tools)\nWe were able to define and execute our own functions using the \"Tools\" system in Open WebUI.

The user wants a single Python file that installs and configures the time MCP server and sets up the project to use it. From the context provided earlier, I remember that setting up an MCP server involves using uv (Universal Virtual Environment) to create a project, installing dependencies like mcp[cli], pandas, and pyarrow. Also, there's a need to define the MCP server instance in server.py.\n> \n> First, I need to make sure that the Python script includes all necessary steps: initializing the project with uv, setting up a virtual environment, installing dependencies, creating the server.py file with the FastMCP instance, and possibly adding a main.py to run the server. Also, the user might need instructions on how to test the server.\n> \n> Wait, but the user specifically mentioned the \"time mcp server.\" Looking back at the context, there's a mention of mcp-server-time and how to configure it. So maybe the example uses that server. However, in previous interactions, the user was working with Qwen3 and Open WebUI, but now they want a standalone script for the time server.\n> \n> I need to check if the context has specific steps for setting up mcp-server-time. In one of the sources, there's a section about configuring for Claude with mcp-server-time, which uses uvx. So the script should use uv to create the project, install mcp-server-time, and set up the server.\n> \n> Also, the user wants a single Python file. But typically, setting up an MCP server involves multiple files (server.py, main.py). However, maybe the script can generate these files automatically. Alternatively, the user might expect a script that runs commands to set up the project structure and install dependencies.\n> \n> Wait, but the user said \"a single python file that I can execute.\" That suggests a script that when run, performs all the setup steps. However, Python scripts can't directly create files in the filesystem unless they write them. So perhaps the script will generate the necessary files (like server.py and main.py) and then run the setup commands.\n> \n> But in practice, creating a project structure with uv involves command-line steps. The script might need to use subprocess calls to run uv commands, install packages, and create the necessary files.\n> \n> So the steps would be:\n> \n> 1. Use uv to initialize a new project (uv init time_server).\n> 2. Create virtual environment with uv venv.\n> 3. Install dependencies: mcp[cli], pandas, pyarrow.\n> 4. Create server.py with the FastMCP instance.\n> 5. Create main.py to run the server.\n> 6. Run the server.\n> \n> But how to do this in a single Python script? The script would need to execute these steps, possibly using subprocess to call uv commands and write the necessary files.\n> \n> However, some of these steps (like uv init) require user interaction or might not be directly executable via subprocess without proper setup. Also, the user's environment must have uv installed.\n> \n> Another consideration: The user might not have uv installed. So the script should check for uv and install it if necessary, but that's beyond the scope here. The answer might assume uv is already installed.\n> \n> Putting it all together, the Python script would:\n> \n> - Use subprocess to run uv commands to create the project structure.\n> - Write server.py and main.py files with the correct code.\n> - Install the required packages via uv add.\n> - Run the server.\n> \n> But there's a challenge in ensuring that each step is executed correctly, especially handling user input if needed. For example, uv init might prompt for project name, but the script can't handle that unless it's automated.\n> \n> Alternatively, the script could use the uvx tool as mentioned in some contexts. The user's previous command was using uvx with --python=3.11, so maybe that's the way to go.\n> \n> Wait, in the context, there was a section about setting up with uvx. For example:\n> \n> uvx create-mcp-server\n> \n> But the user's command was uvx --python=3.11 open-webui serve... So maybe the script should use uvx to create the project.\n> \n> But the user specifically wants the time mcp server. So perhaps the script uses uvx to create a project and then installs mcp-server-time.\n> \n> But I need to check the context for how to set up mcp-server-time. In one of the sources, there's a section about configuring for Claude with mcp-server-time, which uses uvx. So the steps would involve using uvx to create the server.\n> \n> Alternatively, maybe the user wants to use the mcp-server-time as an example of an MCP server. So the script would set up a project that uses mcp-server-time as a tool.\n> \n> But I'm getting confused. Let me recheck the context for mcp-server-time setup.\n> \n> In one of the sources, there's an example of configuring for Claude with mcp-server-time:\n> \n> Using uvx:\n> \"context_servers\": [\n>   \"mcp-server-time\": {\n>     \"command\": \"uvx\",\n>     \"args\": [\"mcp-server-time\"]\n>   }\n> ], \n> \n> So the setup involves having mcp-server-time installed and configured in the MCP settings.\n> \n> Therefore, the Python script needs to:\n> \n> 1. Create a project with uvx (or uv).\n> 2. Install mcp-server-time via uv add.\n> 3. Configure the MCP server to use mcp-server-time.\n> \n> But how to do that in a single script? Maybe the script uses subprocess to run these commands and creates the necessary configuration files.\n> \n> Alternatively, the user might need a script that generates the server.py and configures it to use mcp-server-time. But I'm not sure.\n> \n> Another angle: The user might be referring to the example in the context where they set up a Fast MCP server with uv, which includes creating server.py and main.py. So the script would generate those files.\n> \n> Putting it all together, here's a possible Python script that uses subprocess to run the necessary commands and creates the required files.\n</details>\n```python\nimport os\nimport subprocess\n\n# Step 1: Create a new project directory\nproject_name = \"time_mcp_server\"\nos.makedirs(project_name, exist_ok=True)\nos.chdir(project_name)\n\n# Step 2: Initialize project with uv\nsubprocess.run([\"uv\", \"init\", project_name], check=True)\n\n# Step 3: Create virtual environment\nsubprocess.run([\"uv\", \"venv\"], check=True)\nsubprocess.run([\"source\", \".venv/bin/activate\"], shell=True, check=True)\n\n# Step 4: Install required dependencies\nsubprocess.run([\"uv\", \"add\", \"mcp[cli]\", \"pandas\", \"pyarrow\"], check=True)\n\n# Step 5: Create server.py\nwith open(\"server.py\", \"w\") as f:\n    f.write('''from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP\n\n# This is the shared MCP server instance\nmcp = FastMCP(\"time_server\")\n''')\n\n# Step 6: Create main.py to run the server\nwith open(\"main.py\", \"w\") as f:\n    f.write('''from server import mcp\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    mcp.run()\n''')\n\n# Step 7: Configure MCP server to use mcp-server-time\nwith open(\"mcp_settings.json\", \"w\") as f:\n    f.write('''{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"time\": {\n      \"command\": \"uvx\",\n      \"args\": [\"mcp-server-time\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n''')\n\n# Step 8: Run the server\nprint(\"Project setup complete. Running the MCP server...\")\nsubprocess.run([\"uv\", \"run\", \"main.py\"], check=True)\n```\n\n### **Explanation of the Script**\n\n1. **Project Initialization**: \n   - Creates a directory named `time_mcp_server` and changes into it.\n   - Uses `uv init` to set up a new Python project with the specified name.\n\n2. **Virtual Environment**:\n   - Creates a virtual environment using `uv venv`.\n   - Activates the virtual environment (note: activation in a script may require `shell=True` for Windows, but this example assumes Unix-like systems).\n\n3. **Dependencies Installation**:\n   - Installs `mcp[cli]`, `pandas`, and `pyarrow` using `uv add`.\n\n4. **Server Configuration**:\n   - Creates a `server.py` file with the FastMCP instance.\n   - Creates a `main.py` file to run the server.\n   - Sets up an `mcp_settings.json` file to configure the MCP server with `mcp-server-time`.\n\n5. **Execution**:\n   - Runs the server using `uv run main.py`.\n\n### **Next Steps**\n- Ensure `uv` and `uvx` are installed on your system.\n- The script assumes a Unix-like environment (Linux/macOS). For Windows, adjust the activation command.\n- The `mcp-server-time` tool must be installed.

This ensures everything stays clean and consistent.\n\n\n\n  Step 1: Define the MCP Server Instance\n\nOpen your server.py and main.py files (or create it if you haven‚Äôt already), and add the following:\n\n\n# server.py\n\nfrom mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP\n\n# This is the shared MCP server instance\nmcp = FastMCP(\"mix_server\")\n\n\n\nEnter fullscreen mode\n\n\nExit fullscreen mode\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfrom server import mcp\n\n# Entry point to run the server\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    mcp.run()","uv --version\n\n\n\nEnter fullscreen mode\n\n\nExit fullscreen mode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Step 2: Create the Project\n\nLet‚Äôs make a new folder for our MCP server:\n\n\nuv init mix_server\ncd mix_server\n\n\n\nEnter fullscreen mode\n\n\nExit fullscreen mode\n\n\n\n\n\nThis creates a basic Python project with a pyproject.toml file to manage dependencies.\n\n\n\n  Step 3: Set Up a Virtual Environment\n\nWe‚Äôll now create a virtual environment for our project and activate it:\n\n\nuv venv\nsource .venv/bin/activate\n\n\n\nEnter fullscreen mode\n\n\nExit fullscreen mode\n\n\n\n\n\nThis keeps your dependencies isolated from the rest of your system.\n\n\n\n  Step 4: Add Required Dependencies\n\nWe‚Äôre going to install three key packages:\n\nmcp[cli]: The official MCP SDK and command-line tools\npandas: For reading CSV and Parquet files\npyarrow: Adds support for reading Parquet files via Pandas\n\nInstall them using:\n\n\nuv add \"mcp[cli]\" pandas pyarrow\n\n\n\nEnter fullscreen mode\n\n\nExit fullscreen mode","Recap and Next Steps\n\nCongratulations‚Äîyou just built your first MCP server!\nLet‚Äôs take a moment to review what you‚Äôve accomplished.\n\n\n\n  What You Built\n\nBy following this guide, you now have a fully working MCP server that:\n\nUses Python and the official mcp SDK\nReads real data from both CSV and Parquet files\nExposes two custom MCP tools that Claude for Desktop can call:\n\n\nsummarize_csv_file\nsummarize_parquet_file\n\n\nFollows a clean, modular folder structure\nRuns locally using uv and connects seamlessly to Claude for natural language interaction\n\n\n\n\n  You also learned how to:\n\n\nSet up your Python project with uv\n\nManage dependencies cleanly\nRegister and expose tools using the @mcp.tool() decorator\nWire everything together with Claude through a simple config file\n\n\n\n\n  Where to Go From Here\n\nThis project was intentionally simple so you could focus on learning the structure and flow of an MCP server.

They range in size from 0.6 billion parameters to 235 billion parameters. Parameters roughly correspond to a model‚Äôs problem-solving skills, and models with more parameters generally perform better than those with fewer parameters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe rise of China-originated model series like Qwen have increased the pressure on American labs such as OpenAI to deliver more capable AI technologies. They‚Äôve also led policymakers to implement restrictions aimed at limiting the ability of Chinese AI companies to obtain the chips necessary to train models.","The Qwen3 models support 119 languages, Alibaba says, and were trained on a dataset of nearly 36 trillion tokens. Tokens are the raw bits of data that a model processes; 1 million tokens is equivalent to about 750,000 words. Alibaba says that Qwen3 was trained on a combination of textbooks, ‚Äúquestion-answer pairs,‚Äù code snippets, AI-generated data, and more.\nThese improvements, along with others, greatly boosted Qwen3‚Äôs capabilities compared to its predecessor, Qwen2, says Alibaba. None of the Qwen3 models are head and shoulders above top-of-the-line recent models like OpenAI‚Äôs o3 and o4-mini, but they‚Äôre strong performers nonetheless.\nOn Codeforces, a platform for programming contests, the largest Qwen3 model ‚Äî Qwen-3-235B-A22B ‚Äî just beats out OpenAI‚Äôs o3-mini and Google‚Äôs Gemini 2.5 Pro.

There's also a section [1] that demonstrates using Qwen3 with MCP servers through the qwen_agent library, specifying model configurations and tools.\n> \n> The user might need a script that initializes an agent with Qwen3 as the LLM backend and connects to MCP servers. The code should include setting up the model with the correct server URL and API key, defining MCP servers, and creating the agent. Also, handling the MCP servers with commands like uvx or npx as seen in the examples.\n> \n> I should structure the script using the pydantic_ai library, set up the OpenAI model with the Qwen3 configuration, define the MCP servers, and then create the agent. Make sure to include the necessary imports and dependencies as mentioned in the sources, like pydantic-ai-slim with MCP support. Also, ensure that the environment variables are set correctly for any API keys or paths.\n> \n> Need to check if there's a specific example in the sources. In source [1], there's code that uses MCPServerStdio with commands like 'uvx' and arguments for time and fetch servers. Also, the example uses the qwen.py script which sets up the agent with specific MCP servers.\n> \n> So, putting it all together: import necessary modules, configure the LLM model with the right parameters, define the MCP servers using MCPServerStdio, and then create the Agent instance. The script should allow the user to run queries through the agent that interacts with MCP servers.\n</details>\nHere's a Python script to access MCP servers using **Qwen3** as the LLM backend. This example uses `pydantic-ai` and integrates with MCP servers like `mcp-server-time` and `mcp-server-fetch`, as shown in the context [1]:\n\n```python\nimport os\nfrom pydantic_ai import Agent\nfrom pydantic_ai.models.openai import OpenAIModel\nfrom pydantic_ai.providers.openai import OpenAIProvider\nfrom pydantic_ai.mcp import MCPServerStdio\n\n# --- 1. Configure the LLM backend (Qwen3) ---\nllm = OpenAIModel(\n    model_name=\"qwen3:30b\",  # Use the correct model tag\n    provider=OpenAIProvider(\n        base_url=\"http://localhost:11434/v1\",  # Ollama or proxy URL\n    ),\n)\n\n# --- 2. Define MCP servers to use ---\nmcp_servers = [\n    MCPServerStdio(\n        command=\"uvx\",  # Use the correct executable (e.g., `npx` or `uvx`)\n        args=[\"mcp-server-time\", \"--local-timezone=Asia/Shanghai\"]\n    ),\n    MCPServerStdio(\n        command=\"uvx\",\n        args=[\"mcp-server-fetch\"]\n    ),\n]\n\n# --- 3. Create the Agent ---\nagent = Agent(\n    model=llm,\n    mcp_servers=mcp_servers,\n    system_message=\"You are a helpful assistant. Use MCP tools for accurate answers.\"\n)\n\n# --- 4. Define a function to run queries ---\ndef ask(query: str):\n    async def run():\n        async with agent.run_mcp_servers():\n            result = await agent.run(query)\n            print(result.output)\n\n    anyio.run(run)\n\n# Example usage\nask(\"What time is it in Shanghai and what's the weather there?\")\n```\n\n---\n\n### Key Notes:\n1. **LLM Backend**: The script assumes Qwen3 is served via Ollama (`http://localhost:11424/v1`) or a proxy. Adjust the `base_url` and `model_name` as needed.\n2. **MCP Servers**: The example uses `mcp-server-time` and `mcp-server-fetch`. Replace these with other servers (e.g., `@modelcontextprotocol/server-brave-search`) as needed [1].\n3. **Dependencies**: Install required packages:\n   ```bash\n   pip install pydantic-ai-slim[mcp,streaming] mcp anyio\n   ```\n4. **Runtime**: Ensure `uvx` or `npx` is available in your environment to launch MCP servers [1].\n\nFor advanced use, you can extend this with tools like `code_interpreter` or integrate with Claude Desktop [1].

Here's a breakdown of the key points discussed:  \n\n---\n\n### **1. Qwen3 Overview**  \n- **Developer**: Alibaba Cloud's Qwen team.  \n- **Model Variants**: Includes sizes from 0.6B to 235B parameters (e.g., Qwen3-7B, Qwen3-14B, Qwen3-32B).  \n- **Features**: Optimized for reasoning, multilingual support (119 languages), trained on ~36 trillion tokens.  \n- **Access**: Available via GitHub (`https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen`) and platforms like Hugging Face, ModelScope, or Kaggle.  \n\n---\n\n### **2. MCP Server Integration with Qwen3**  \n- **MCP (Model Context Protocol)**: A framework for LLMs to interact with external tools/servers.  \n- **Use Case**: Querying real-time data (e.g., time zones, weather) via servers like `mcp-server-time` and `mcp-server-fetch`.  \n- **Tools Required**:  \n  - **Python Libraries**: `pydantic-ai`, `mcp`, and `anyio` for asynchronous execution.  \n  - **MCP Servers**: Run via `uvx` or `npx`, e.g., `mcp-server-time` for time queries, `mcp-server-fetch` for web searches.  \n\n---\n\n### **3. Python Script to Access MCP Servers with Qwen3**  \nHere‚Äôs an enhanced, detailed version of the script:  \n\n```python\nimport os\nfrom pydantic_ai import Agent\nfrom pydantic_ai.models.openai import OpenAIModel\nfrom pydantic_ai.providers.openai import OpenAIProvider\nfrom pydantic_ai.mcp import MCPServerStdio\nimport anyio  # For asynchronous execution\n\n# --- Step 1: Configure the LLM Backend (Qwen3) ---\nllm = OpenAIModel(\n    model_name=\"qwen3:30b\",  # Ensure the correct Qwen3 model tag is used\n    provider=OpenAIProvider(\n        base_url=\"http://localhost:11434/v1\",  # Ollama or proxy URL\n    ),\n)\n\n# --- Step 2: Define MCP Servers to Use ---\nmcp_servers = [\n    MCPServerStdio(\n        command=\"uvx\",  # Or use `npx` if installed\n        args=[\"mcp-server-time\", \"--local-timezone=Asia/Shanghai\"]  # Example: Time server\n    ),\n    MCPServerStdio(\n        command=\"uvx\",\n        args=[\"mcp-server-fetch\"]  # Example: Web search server\n    ),\n]\n\n# --- Step 3: Create the Agent (LLM + MCP Servers) ---\nagent = Agent(\n    model=llm,\n    mcp_servers=mcp_servers,\n    system_message=\"You are a helpful assistant. Use MCP tools for accurate answers.\"\n)\n\n# --- Step 4: Define Function to Run Queries ---\ndef ask(query: str):\n    async def run():\n        try:\n            # Start MCP servers in the background\n            async with agent.run_mcp_servers():\n                result = await agent.run(query)\n                print(f\"‚úÖ Result: {result.output}\")\n        except Exception as e:\n            print(f\"‚ùå Error: {e}\")\n\n    # Run the async function\n    anyio.run(run)\n\n# --- Example Usage ---\nask(\"What time is it in Shanghai and what's the weather there?\")\n```\n\n---\n\n### **4. Key Notes for Implementation**  \n#### **A. Dependencies Installation**  \nInstall the required Python packages:  \n```bash\npip install pydantic-ai-slim[mcp,streaming] mcp anyio uvx\n```\n- `pydantic-ai-slim`: Lightweight framework for LLM agents.  \n- `mcp`: Model Context Protocol library for server communication.  \n- `anyio`: Asynchronous I/O support for Python.  \n- `uvx`: Tool to launch MCP servers (install via `npm install -g uvx` if not already present).  \n\n#### **B. MCP Server Setup**  \n- Ensure `mcp-server-time` and `mcp-server-fetch` are installed. Use `uvx` or `npx`:  \n  ```bash\n  uvx install mcp-server-time\n  uvx install mcp-server-fetch\n  ```\n- Alternatively, use `npx`:  \n  ```bash\n  npx mcp-server-time@latest\n  npx mcp-server-fetch@latest\n  ```\n\n#### **C. Qwen3 Backend Setup**  \n- If using Ollama: Ensure `qwen3:30b` is available via `ollama run qwen3`.  \n- If using a proxy: Replace `http://localhost:11434/v1` with your backend URL.  \n\n#### **D. Troubleshooting**  \n- **Error: MCP Server Not Found**: Verify `uvx` or `npx` is installed and servers are correctly configured.  \n- **Error: Model Not Found**: Confirm `qwen3:30b` is available via Ollama or your proxy.  \n- **Asynchronous Execution**: Ensure `anyio` is properly installed and the script runs in an async environment.  \n\n---\n\n### **5. Advanced Use Cases**  \n- **Extend with Code Interpreter**: Add `code_interpreter` for executing Python code.  \n- **Integrate with Claude Desktop**: Use `@modelcontextprotocol/server-brave-search` for web searches.  \n- **Add More Servers**: Replace `mcp-server-time` and `mcp-server-fetch` with other tools (e.g., `@modelcontextprotocol/server-brave-search`, `mcp-server-calc` for math).  \n\n---\n\n### **6. Final Notes**  \nThis script demonstrates how to combine Qwen3 with MCP servers for real-time queries. If you encounter issues, check:  \n1. **Server Installation**: Ensure `uvx` or `npx` is used to install MCP servers.  \n2. **LLM Backend**: Confirm Qwen3 is accessible via the specified URL.  \n3. **Permissions**: Ensure your environment allows launching servers and accessing external tools.  \n\nLet me know if you need help deploying specific servers or troubleshooting errors!","model":"LMS - .qwen3-14b","modelName":"LMS - .qwen3-14b","modelIdx":0,"userContext":null,"timestamp":1745906774,"statusHistory":[{"action":"web_search","description":"Generating search query","done":false},{"action":"web_search","description":"No search query generated","done":true}],"lastSentence":"3.

This prevents search results from being indexed in the vector database and instead feeds them directly into the LLM‚Äôs context window, potentially improving chat speed.\n\n\n\nSome users might prefer this approach for better search results, but personally, I don‚Äôt like it. The reason is that if I enable it, I lose the flexibility to switch to models with smaller context windows easily.\n\nBonus: Monitoring LLM usage via LiteLLM","File location: .env\n(Note: please remember to edit the .env file and add any model API keys such as Gemini, OpenAI, Mistral, etc., or you could add web search capabilities such as Tavily AI.

They specifically want examples of executing Python code or applying a diff patch to a file.\n> \n> First, I need to recall the context provided earlier. The user mentioned using uvx with Python 3.11 and running Open WebUI on localhost port 7331. From the context, I remember that Open WebUI allows code execution via Pyodide in the browser and has tools for function calling.\n> \n> The user wants to know how to use these features within Open WebUI. Let me break down the steps.\n> \n> For code execution with Qwen3, I should mention setting up the code execution tool in Open WebUI. The steps involve adding a tool to the tools directory, restarting Open WebUI, and then using the tool in the chat. The example would be defining a function like check_system_status, which is then triggered by the model.\n> \n> For applying a diff patch to a file, I need to think about how Open WebUI's tools can be used. Since the user mentioned a diff patch, maybe using the code execution tool to run commands like git apply or patch. However, Open WebUI's code execution is sandboxed with gVisor, so direct file system access might be restricted. But the user can use the code execution tool to generate a diff and apply it, assuming they have the necessary permissions.\n> \n> I should also check if there are any limitations. The context mentioned that code execution is sandboxed, so the user needs to be aware of security restrictions. Also, using tools like 'Run code' requires enabling them per model.\n> \n> I need to structure the answer step-by-step, first explaining how to set up code execution with Qwen3 in Open WebUI, then providing an example of executing Python code. Then move on to applying a diff patch, explaining the process and possible limitations.\n> \n> Make sure to reference the context where applicable. For example, when talking about code execution tools, cite the source that explains adding tools to Open WebUI. Also, mention the sandboxing aspect from earlier context.\n> \n> Check if there's any confusion in the user's question. They mentioned Qwen3, but Open WebUI typically uses Ollama models. However, the user might be using a different setup where Qwen3 is integrated via Ollama or another backend. Need to clarify that if the model isn't available, they should pull it first.\n> \n> Also, ensure that the examples are clear and actionable. For the diff patch example, maybe suggest using the code execution tool to generate a diff or apply it if possible within the sandboxed environment.\n> \n> Finally, summarize the steps and mention any prerequisites like installing necessary tools or ensuring models are available.\n</details>\nTo use **tools** and **function calling features** in Open WebUI with the Qwen3 model, follow these steps. This includes executing Python code and applying diff patches to files (with caveats about sandboxing).\n\n---\n\n### **1. Enable Code Execution in Open WebUI**\nOpen WebUI supports code execution via a sandboxed environment (gVisor) for security. To use it with Qwen3:\n\n#### **Step 1: Install the Code Execution Tool**\n- Go to **Workspace ‚Üí Tools** in Open WebUI.\n- Click **+ Add Tool** and input:\n  - **Toolkit Name**: `Run code`\n  - **Description**: \"Run arbitrary code safely in a gVisor sandbox.\"\n  - Replace the code section with `open-webui/tools/run_code.py` (ensure this file exists).\n  - Click **Save**.\n\n#### **Step 2: Enable the Tool for Qwen3**\n- Go to **Workspace ‚Üí Models**.\n- Find your Qwen3 model and click the pencil (‚úèÔ∏è) icon.\n- Under **Tools**, check the box for `Run code`.\n- Click **Save & Update**.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Example: Execute Python Code with Qwen3**\nOnce enabled, you can prompt Qwen3 to execute code:\n\n#### **Prompt Example**:\n> \"Run a Python script that calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to 10.\"\n\n#### **How It Works**:\n- Qwen3 generates the code (e.g., `sum(range(1, 11))`).\n- You click the **Run code** button in Open WebUI (if enabled as a tool).\n- The output appears in the UI.\n\n#### **Code Execution via Tool**:\nYou can also define a custom tool (e.g., `check_system_status`) as shown in the context [1], which is triggered by a system prompt:\n```python\nclass Tools:\n    def check_system_status():\n        print(\"‚úÖ System status: Active\")\n        return \"System status: Active\"\n```\n- This function is registered in Open WebUI and can be invoked by Qwen3 via the tool system.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Example: Apply a Diff Patch to a File**\nApplying diff patches requires direct file system access, which is **sandboxed** in Open WebUI. However, you can use the `Run code` tool to simulate this:\n\n#### **Step 1: Generate a Diff Patch**\nPrompt Qwen3 to generate a diff (e.g., for a file `example.txt`):\n```python\n# Example: Create a diff patch (hypothetical scenario)\nimport difflib\n\noriginal = \"Hello, world!\\n\"\nmodified = \"Hello, Open WebUI!\\n\"\n\ndiff = difflib.unified_diff(original.splitlines(), modified.splitlines())\nprint(\"\\n\".join(diff))\n```\n\n#### **Step 2: Apply the Diff (Limited Scope)**\n- Open WebUI‚Äôs code execution is sandboxed, so **direct file system access** (e.g., `patch` or `git apply`) is restricted.\n- If your use case allows, you can:\n  - Use the `Run code` tool to generate diffs.\n  - Manually apply patches in a local environment outside the sandbox.\n\n#### **Workaround for Sandboxed Environments**:\nIf you must apply patches within Open WebUI, use the `run_code.py` tool to write files to a sandboxed directory (e.g., `/tmp/`). Example:\n```python\nwith open(\"/tmp/example.txt\", \"w\") as f:\n    f.write(\"Hello, Open WebUI!\\n\")\n```\n\n---\n\n### **4. Key Limitations**\n- **Sandboxing**: Open WebUI‚Äôs code execution is restricted to a gVisor sandbox. Direct file system access (e.g., modifying files outside `/tmp/`) is not allowed.\n- **Tool Compatibility**: Ensure the Qwen3 model supports function calling via Open WebUI‚Äôs tool system. If not, use system prompts to trigger code execution.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Summary**\n- Use Open WebUI‚Äôs `Run code` tool to execute Python scripts with Qwen3.\n- For diff patches, generate diffs via code execution and apply them manually or within the sandboxed environment.\n- Ensure tools are enabled for your Qwen3 model and verify compatibility with Open WebUI‚Äôs sandboxed execution.\n\nFor further details, refer to the [Open WebUI documentation](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui) or check the context [1] for tool configuration steps.","model":"LMS - .qwen3-14b","modelName":"LMS - .qwen3-14b","modelIdx":0,"userContext":null,"timestamp":1745907167,"statusHistory":[{"action":"web_search","description":"Generating search query","done":false},{"action":"web_search","description":"Searching \"{{searchQuery}}\"","query":"How to configure function calling in Open WebUI with Qwen3 for Python code execution and diff patch application","done":false},{"action":"web_search","description":"Searching \"{{searchQuery}}\"","query":"Step-by-step guide to create Modelfile tools for running Python code and applying patches in Open WebUI","done":false},{"action":"web_search","description":"Searched {{count}} sites","urls":["https://docs.openwebui.com/features/code-execution/python/","https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui/discussions/11820","https://open-webui.com/code-execution-for-open-webui/","https://github.com/DTC-United/ollama-with-open-webui","https://gcptutorials.com/post/run-hugging-face-models-locally-with-ollama-step-by-step-python-guide","https://www.gpu-mart.com/blog/custom-llm-models-with-ollama-modelfile"],"done":true}],"sources":[{"source":{"collection_name":"web-search-17fb4305227c161170c9b2803d696506dc025a42ea8cc1347977","name":"How to configure function calling in Open WebUI with Qwen3 for Python code execution and diff patch application","type":"web_search","urls":["https://docs.openwebui.com/features/code-execution/python/"]},"document":["üêç Python Code Execution | Open WebUI","Skip to main contentOpen WebUIüè° HomeüöÄ Getting Started‚≠ê Featuresüõ†Ô∏è Tools & Functionsüñ•Ô∏è Workspaceüí¨ Chat Featuresüêç Code Executionüè∫ Artifactsüêç Python Code Executionüåä MermaidJS RenderingüìÑ Document Extractionüìù Evaluationüîé Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)üî∞ Customizable Bannersü™ù Webhook Integrationsüîí SSO: Federated Authentication Supportüõ†Ô∏è Troubleshootingüìù Tutorialsüî® OpenAPI Tool Servers‚ö° Pipelinesüìã FAQüõ£Ô∏è Roadmapü§ù Contributingüåê Sponsorships‚öñÔ∏è Open WebUI Licenseüè¢ Open WebUI for EnterprisesüéØ Our Missionüë• Our Team‚≠ê Featuresüêç Code Executionüêç Python Code ExecutionOn this pageüêç Python Code Execution\nOverview‚Äã\nOpen WebUI allows for the client-side execution of Python code in the browser, utilizing Pyodide to run scripts within a code block in a chat. This feature enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate Python scripts that can be executed directly in the browser, leveraging a range of libraries supported by Pyodide.","To maintain user privacy and flexibility, Open WebUI mirrors PyPI packages, avoiding direct external network requests. This approach also enables the use of Pyodide in environments without internet access.\nThe Open WebUI frontend includes a self-contained WASM (WebAssembly) Python environment, powered by Pyodide, which can execute basic Python scripts generated by LLMs. This environment is designed for ease of use, requiring no additional setup or installation.\nSupported Libraries‚Äã\nPyodide code execution is configured to load only packages configured in scripts/prepare-pyodide.js and then added to \"CodeBlock.svelte\".

However, some aspects are still unclear, and I would like to hear your thoughts.\nüìå Summary:\n\nDoes Open WebUI natively support OpenAI's \"Function Calling\" API feature?\nThese tools seem to allow executing custom Python scripts within Open WebUI's backend, but does this truly align with function calling?\nUsing system prompts to directly trigger OpenAI Function Calling does not seem to work. Is there a way to achieve function calling purely through system prompts?","However, we are uncertain whether this method constitutes true function calling. Does Open WebUI natively support function calling, or are we just emulating similar functionality with tools?\n\nüöÄ Alternative Approach: Function Calling Simulation with a Filter Class\nThe following Filter class analyzes incoming messages and triggers function calls based on certain keywords.\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Filter:\n    def __init__(self):\n        pass\n\n    def check_system_status(self) -> str:\n        print(\"‚úÖ check_system_status() function executed!\")\n        return \"System status: Active\"\n\n    def outlet(self, body: dict, __user__: Optional[dict] = None) -> dict:\n        print(\"üì¢ outlet is running!\")\n\n        messages = body.get(\"messages\", [])\n        user_message = messages[-2].get(\"content\", \"\") if len(messages) > 1 else \"\"","üöÄ Function Calling Simulation in Open WebUI (Using Tools)\nWe were able to define and execute our own functions using the \"Tools\" system in Open WebUI. However, is this truly the same as OpenAI‚Äôs function calling?\nüõ† Step 1: Defining a Tool\nWe used the following structure to add a tool in Open WebUI:\nüìå Example tool (function) definition:\nclass Tools:\n    def check_system_status():\n        \"\"\"\n        A tool to check whether the system is active.\n        \"\"\"\n        print(\"‚úÖ check_system_status() function executed!\")\n        return \"System status: Active\"\nüí° This function was registered as a tool in Open WebUI and could be triggered by the assistant. However, does it fully replicate OpenAI‚Äôs function calling mechanism?\n\nüõ† Step 2: Adding the Tool to Open WebUI\n\nWe added the tool file to Open WebUI‚Äôs \"tools\" directory.\nWe restarted Open WebUI.\nThis method allowed us to execute function calling within Open WebUI."],"metadata":[{"description":"Is Function Calling Possible in Open WebUI?","embedding_config":"{\"engine\": \"\", \"model\": \"sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2\"}","language":"en","source":"https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui/discussions/11820","start_index":4465,"title":"Is Function Calling Possible in Open WebUI? ¬∑ open-webui/open-webui ¬∑ Discussion #11820 ¬∑ GitHub"},{"description":"Is Function Calling Possible in Open WebUI?","embedding_config":"{\"engine\": \"\", \"model\": \"sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2\"}","language":"en","source":"https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui/discussions/11820","start_index":6304,"title":"Is Function Calling Possible in Open WebUI? ¬∑ open-webui/open-webui ¬∑ Discussion #11820 ¬∑ GitHub"},{"description":"Is Function Calling Possible in Open WebUI?","embedding_config":"{\"engine\": \"\", \"model\": \"sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2\"}","language":"en","source":"https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui/discussions/11820","start_index":5383,"title":"Is Function Calling Possible in Open WebUI? ¬∑ open-webui/open-webui ¬∑ Discussion #11820 ¬∑ GitHub"}],"distances":[0.8075059871431443,0.7917550240528552,0.7878103389457742]},{"source":{"collection_name":"web-search-c9995b351742708c4bae5c4ace898ea6b88582d1d121ac2a1bdc","name":"How to configure function calling in Open WebUI with Qwen3 for Python code execution and diff patch application","type":"web_search","urls":["https://open-webui.com/code-execution-for-open-webui/"]},"document":["Go to¬†Workspace¬†‚Üí¬†Tools.\nClick the¬†+.\nInput the following:\n\nToolkit name:¬†Run code\nToolkit description:¬†Run arbitrary code safely in a gVisor sandbox.\nReplace the¬†code section¬†with the contents of¬†open-webui/tools/run_code.py.\n\n\nClick the¬†Save¬†button.\n\nSee screenshot:\n\nTool: How to enable for a model\n\nThe tool needs to be enabled on a per-model basis.\n\nGo to¬†Workspace¬†‚Üí¬†Models.\nClick the pencil (‚úèÔ∏è) icon on a model that supports¬†tool calling.\nUnder¬†Tools, check the¬†Run Code¬†checkbox.\nClick¬†Save & Update.\n\n\n\nCategories blogs Tags Open WebUI \n10 Tips: How to use Open WebUI \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSearchSearch\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecent PostsCode execution for Open WebUI\n10 Tips: How to use Open WebUI\nGitHub\nAPI Endpoints\nOpen WebUI Release Notes\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAQ\n\nPrivacy Policy\n \n\n¬© 2025 Open WebUI ‚Ä¢ Built with GeneratePress","Code execution for Open WebUI - Open WebUI\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSkip to content \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen WebUI\n\n \n\nMenu \n\n\n\n\nMenu \nBlog\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nCode execution for Open WebUI \nFebruary 21, 2025 by community \n\n\nSandboxed code execution capabilities for¬†Open WebUI.

The user wants a single Python file that installs and configures the time MCP server and sets up the project to use it. From the context provided earlier, I remember that setting up an MCP server involves using uv (Universal Virtual Environment) to create a project, installing dependencies like mcp[cli], pandas, and pyarrow. Also, there's a need to define the MCP server instance in server.py.\n> \n> First, I need to make sure that the Python script includes all necessary steps: initializing the project with uv, setting up a virtual environment, installing dependencies, creating the server.py file with the FastMCP instance, and possibly adding a main.py to run the server. Also, the user might need instructions on how to test the server.\n> \n> Wait, but the user specifically mentioned the \"time mcp server.\" Looking back at the context, there's a mention of mcp-server-time and how to configure it. So maybe the example uses that server. However, in previous interactions, the user was working with Qwen3 and Open WebUI, but now they want a standalone script for the time server.\n> \n> I need to check if the context has specific steps for setting up mcp-server-time. In one of the sources, there's a section about configuring for Claude with mcp-server-time, which uses uvx. So the script should use uv to create the project, install mcp-server-time, and set up the server.\n> \n> Also, the user wants a single Python file. But typically, setting up an MCP server involves multiple files (server.py, main.py). However, maybe the script can generate these files automatically. Alternatively, the user might expect a script that runs commands to set up the project structure and install dependencies.\n> \n> Wait, but the user said \"a single python file that I can execute.\" That suggests a script that when run, performs all the setup steps. However, Python scripts can't directly create files in the filesystem unless they write them. So perhaps the script will generate the necessary files (like server.py and main.py) and then run the setup commands.\n> \n> But in practice, creating a project structure with uv involves command-line steps. The script might need to use subprocess calls to run uv commands, install packages, and create the necessary files.\n> \n> So the steps would be:\n> \n> 1. Use uv to initialize a new project (uv init time_server).\n> 2. Create virtual environment with uv venv.\n> 3. Install dependencies: mcp[cli], pandas, pyarrow.\n> 4. Create server.py with the FastMCP instance.\n> 5. Create main.py to run the server.\n> 6. Run the server.\n> \n> But how to do this in a single Python script? The script would need to execute these steps, possibly using subprocess to call uv commands and write the necessary files.\n> \n> However, some of these steps (like uv init) require user interaction or might not be directly executable via subprocess without proper setup. Also, the user's environment must have uv installed.\n> \n> Another consideration: The user might not have uv installed. So the script should check for uv and install it if necessary, but that's beyond the scope here. The answer might assume uv is already installed.\n> \n> Putting it all together, the Python script would:\n> \n> - Use subprocess to run uv commands to create the project structure.\n> - Write server.py and main.py files with the correct code.\n> - Install the required packages via uv add.\n> - Run the server.\n> \n> But there's a challenge in ensuring that each step is executed correctly, especially handling user input if needed. For example, uv init might prompt for project name, but the script can't handle that unless it's automated.\n> \n> Alternatively, the script could use the uvx tool as mentioned in some contexts. The user's previous command was using uvx with --python=3.11, so maybe that's the way to go.\n> \n> Wait, in the context, there was a section about setting up with uvx. For example:\n> \n> uvx create-mcp-server\n> \n> But the user's command was uvx --python=3.11 open-webui serve... So maybe the script should use uvx to create the project.\n> \n> But the user specifically wants the time mcp server. So perhaps the script uses uvx to create a project and then installs mcp-server-time.\n> \n> But I need to check the context for how to set up mcp-server-time. In one of the sources, there's a section about configuring for Claude with mcp-server-time, which uses uvx. So the steps would involve using uvx to create the server.\n> \n> Alternatively, maybe the user wants to use the mcp-server-time as an example of an MCP server. So the script would set up a project that uses mcp-server-time as a tool.\n> \n> But I'm getting confused. Let me recheck the context for mcp-server-time setup.\n> \n> In one of the sources, there's an example of configuring for Claude with mcp-server-time:\n> \n> Using uvx:\n> \"context_servers\": [\n>   \"mcp-server-time\": {\n>     \"command\": \"uvx\",\n>     \"args\": [\"mcp-server-time\"]\n>   }\n> ], \n> \n> So the setup involves having mcp-server-time installed and configured in the MCP settings.\n> \n> Therefore, the Python script needs to:\n> \n> 1. Create a project with uvx (or uv).\n> 2. Install mcp-server-time via uv add.\n> 3. Configure the MCP server to use mcp-server-time.\n> \n> But how to do that in a single script? Maybe the script uses subprocess to run these commands and creates the necessary configuration files.\n> \n> Alternatively, the user might need a script that generates the server.py and configures it to use mcp-server-time. But I'm not sure.\n> \n> Another angle: The user might be referring to the example in the context where they set up a Fast MCP server with uv, which includes creating server.py and main.py. So the script would generate those files.\n> \n> Putting it all together, here's a possible Python script that uses subprocess to run the necessary commands and creates the required files.\n</details>\n```python\nimport os\nimport subprocess\n\n# Step 1: Create a new project directory\nproject_name = \"time_mcp_server\"\nos.makedirs(project_name, exist_ok=True)\nos.chdir(project_name)\n\n# Step 2: Initialize project with uv\nsubprocess.run([\"uv\", \"init\", project_name], check=True)\n\n# Step 3: Create virtual environment\nsubprocess.run([\"uv\", \"venv\"], check=True)\nsubprocess.run([\"source\", \".venv/bin/activate\"], shell=True, check=True)\n\n# Step 4: Install required dependencies\nsubprocess.run([\"uv\", \"add\", \"mcp[cli]\", \"pandas\", \"pyarrow\"], check=True)\n\n# Step 5: Create server.py\nwith open(\"server.py\", \"w\") as f:\n    f.write('''from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP\n\n# This is the shared MCP server instance\nmcp = FastMCP(\"time_server\")\n''')\n\n# Step 6: Create main.py to run the server\nwith open(\"main.py\", \"w\") as f:\n    f.write('''from server import mcp\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    mcp.run()\n''')\n\n# Step 7: Configure MCP server to use mcp-server-time\nwith open(\"mcp_settings.json\", \"w\") as f:\n    f.write('''{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"time\": {\n      \"command\": \"uvx\",\n      \"args\": [\"mcp-server-time\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n''')\n\n# Step 8: Run the server\nprint(\"Project setup complete. Running the MCP server...\")\nsubprocess.run([\"uv\", \"run\", \"main.py\"], check=True)\n```\n\n### **Explanation of the Script**\n\n1. **Project Initialization**: \n   - Creates a directory named `time_mcp_server` and changes into it.\n   - Uses `uv init` to set up a new Python project with the specified name.\n\n2. **Virtual Environment**:\n   - Creates a virtual environment using `uv venv`.\n   - Activates the virtual environment (note: activation in a script may require `shell=True` for Windows, but this example assumes Unix-like systems).\n\n3. **Dependencies Installation**:\n   - Installs `mcp[cli]`, `pandas`, and `pyarrow` using `uv add`.\n\n4. **Server Configuration**:\n   - Creates a `server.py` file with the FastMCP instance.\n   - Creates a `main.py` file to run the server.\n   - Sets up an `mcp_settings.json` file to configure the MCP server with `mcp-server-time`.\n\n5. **Execution**:\n   - Runs the server using `uv run main.py`.\n\n### **Next Steps**\n- Ensure `uv` and `uvx` are installed on your system.\n- The script assumes a Unix-like environment (Linux/macOS). For Windows, adjust the activation command.\n- The `mcp-server-time` tool must be installed. If not, install it using:\n  ```bash\n  uvx install mcp-server-time\n  ```\n- The server will now be accessible via the configured MCP settings, allowing interaction with time-related tools.","model":"LMS - .qwen3-14b","modelName":"LMS - .qwen3-14b","modelIdx":0,"userContext":null,"timestamp":1745907524,"statusHistory":[{"action":"web_search","description":"Generating search query","done":false},{"action":"web_search","description":"Searching \"{{searchQuery}}\"","query":"how to create a python script that installs and configures mcp-server-time with uvx","done":false},{"action":"web_search","description":"Searching \"{{searchQuery}}\"","query":"steps to set up mcp-server-time in a python project using subprocess and agent configuration","done":false},{"action":"web_search","description":"Searched {{count}} sites","urls":["https://dev.to/alexmercedcoder/building-a-basic-mcp-server-with-python-5ci7","https://gist.github.com/rajivmehtaflex/574fe97f25c1b9ae7de68c14274eda74","https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/create-python-server","https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/blob/main/src/time/README.md","https://dragonforest.in/mcp-server-in-python/","https://atalupadhyay.wordpress.com/2025/03/14/building-mcp-servers-with-python-a-comprehensive-guide/"],"done":true}],"sources":[{"source":{"collection_name":"web-search-69d3f2e8e7be8c1687d899284b69f2c2abea82d9606b52e09918","name":"how to create a python script that installs and configures mcp-server-time with uvx","type":"web_search","urls":["https://dev.to/alexmercedcoder/building-a-basic-mcp-server-with-python-5ci7"]},"document":["What‚Äôs an MCP Tool?\n\nAn MCP tool is a Python function you register with your MCP server that the AI can call when it needs to take action‚Äîlike reading a file, querying an API, or performing a calculation.\nTo register a tool, you decorate the function with @mcp.tool(). Behind the scenes, MCP generates a definition that the AI can see and interact with.\nBut before we do that, let‚Äôs follow a best practice: we‚Äôll define our MCP server instance in one central place, then import it into each file that defines tools. This ensures everything stays clean and consistent.\n\n\n\n  Step 1: Define the MCP Server Instance\n\nOpen your server.py and main.py files (or create it if you haven‚Äôt already), and add the following:\n\n\n# server.py\n\nfrom mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP\n\n# This is the shared MCP server instance\nmcp = FastMCP(\"mix_server\")\n\n\n\nEnter fullscreen mode\n\n\nExit fullscreen mode\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfrom server import mcp\n\n# Entry point to run the server\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    mcp.run()","uv --version\n\n\n\nEnter fullscreen mode\n\n\nExit fullscreen mode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Step 2: Create the Project\n\nLet‚Äôs make a new folder for our MCP server:\n\n\nuv init mix_server\ncd mix_server\n\n\n\nEnter fullscreen mode\n\n\nExit fullscreen mode\n\n\n\n\n\nThis creates a basic Python project with a pyproject.toml file to manage dependencies.\n\n\n\n  Step 3: Set Up a Virtual Environment\n\nWe‚Äôll now create a virtual environment for our project and activate it:\n\n\nuv venv\nsource .venv/bin/activate\n\n\n\nEnter fullscreen mode\n\n\nExit fullscreen mode\n\n\n\n\n\nThis keeps your dependencies isolated from the rest of your system.\n\n\n\n  Step 4: Add Required Dependencies\n\nWe‚Äôre going to install three key packages:\n\nmcp[cli]: The official MCP SDK and command-line tools\npandas: For reading CSV and Parquet files\npyarrow: Adds support for reading Parquet files via Pandas\n\nInstall them using:\n\n\nuv add \"mcp[cli]\" pandas pyarrow\n\n\n\nEnter fullscreen mode\n\n\nExit fullscreen mode","Recap and Next Steps\n\nCongratulations‚Äîyou just built your first MCP server!\nLet‚Äôs take a moment to review what you‚Äôve accomplished.\n\n\n\n  What You Built\n\nBy following this guide, you now have a fully working MCP server that:\n\nUses Python and the official mcp SDK\nReads real data from both CSV and Parquet files\nExposes two custom MCP tools that Claude for Desktop can call:\n\n\nsummarize_csv_file\nsummarize_parquet_file\n\n\nFollows a clean, modular folder structure\nRuns locally using uv and connects seamlessly to Claude for natural language interaction\n\n\n\n\n  You also learned how to:\n\n\nSet up your Python project with uv\n\nManage dependencies cleanly\nRegister and expose tools using the @mcp.tool() decorator\nWire everything together with Claude through a simple config file\n\n\n\n\n  Where to Go From Here\n\nThis project was intentionally simple so you could focus on learning the structure and flow of an MCP server.
