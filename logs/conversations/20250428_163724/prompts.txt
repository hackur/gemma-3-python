Human: ### Task:
Generate 1-3 broad tags categorizing the main themes of the chat history, along with 1-3 more specific subtopic tags.

### Guidelines:
- Start with high-level domains (e.g. Science, Technology, Philosophy, Arts, Politics, Business, Health, Sports, Entertainment, Education)
- Consider including relevant subfields/subdomains if they are strongly represented throughout the conversation
- If content is too short (less than 3 messages) or too diverse, use only ["General"]
- Use the chat's primary language; default to English if multilingual
- Prioritize accuracy over specificity

### Output:
JSON format: { "tags": ["tag1", "tag2", "tag3"] }

### Chat History:
<chat_history>
USER: Tell me about what you can do.
ASSISTANT: As a large language model, I can communicate in response to a wide range of prompts and questions. I can provide summaries of factual topics, create stories, and translate languages. I can also generate different creative text formats, like poems, code, scripts, musical pieces, email, letters, etc.
